&amp;#x200B;

Tesla has rebounded strongly this year, sparking debate about whether the company and the electric car industry are still in hot demand.

&amp;#x200B;

As of Thursday's close, Tesla had risen 104 percent from its intraday low on Jan. 6.

&amp;#x200B;

U.S. growth stocks, notably Tesla, were hit hard last year by fears of a Federal Reserve rate hike and a recession. For all of last year, Tesla fell more than 65%.

&amp;#x200B;

In January, Tesla took the almost unprecedented step of slashing 10 to 20 percent off its Model 3 and Model Y models, setting off a price war among other automakers and fueling new demand for Tesla.

&amp;#x200B;

Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives thinks Tesla's price cut was a ""stroke of genius"" :

&amp;#x200B;

The 2023 demand outlook has even outpaced the bull market, triggering prolonged short-covering.

&amp;#x200B;

Cathie Wood, a die-hard Tesla fan, said in an interview that she believes the price cut is due to Tesla's cost leadership in battery technology. With that kind of leadership, Tesla can continue to lower prices and spur more demand:

&amp;#x200B;

I think traditional automakers will have a hard time keeping up with the price reductions that Tesla's technology brings.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, renewed investor optimism about the economy and bets that the Fed's aggressive rate-hike cycle is coming to an end have made Tesla one of the hottest stocks so far this year.

&amp;#x200B;

Marco Iachini, senior vice president of research at Vanda Securities, said retail investors have been ""amazingly persistent and sizable"" in buying Tesla shares this year, with Tesla attracting 33 percent of all net purchases of securities in the United States this week alone:

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla has certainly been the prime target of retail buying so far this year.

&amp;#x200B;

Similarly to Ives, Iachini believes the recent ""hunger"" for Tesla's stock may be driven by a desire to chase the stock higher and recoup losses, given the amount of pain traders have inflicted on the stock over the past year.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, in early February, the federal government said it would expand a newly revised electric vehicle tax credit to allow SUVs costing up to $80,000 to receive them, a move that would also help Tesla.

&amp;#x200B;

But not everyone on Wall Street is sanguine about Tesla, with some analysts arguing that price cuts will hurt the brand in the long run, as well as margins.

&amp;#x200B;

Bank of America analyst John Murphy said in an interview:

&amp;#x200B;

According to Musk's statement on the fourth-quarter earnings call, he said his demand was twice his supply, so it would be foolish to cut prices.

&amp;#x200B;

Doing so will only eat into your profitability, and you won't see any incremental gains in the short term.",0,8,"The faith is still there! Tesla has ""doubled. Do you envy? I got the price cut.

After a good run in 2020, where at one point I had 750k in my account, I managed to lose it all - every single penny, in a week. My losses till 1st Feb '23, stood at 484k in Robinhood. As much as I want to make fun of my situation, it was unbelievably scarring. The only good thing was that I didn't own a home or wasn't settled otherwise guilt would be through the roof.

Took few months of break and returned only with 1k &amp; set of rules. Result so far = 180 times return.

How did this happen? (Major wins)

1. Pure luck -&gt; FB calls before ER. This was the ignition that gave me 30k from 1k
2. Netflix puts twice - one this Tuesday where it dipped from 362 to 356 and today where it dipped all the way to 350
3. Disney Puts today (post ER)
4. TSLA calls on Wed &amp; Thursday (once Investor news was out)
5. TSLA puts today (Once Model Y price increased in China)

I was up till 250k at one point today but got distracted with few meetings and then decided to sell everything i.e. 180k. Not keeping any positions over the weekend. Here's my plan next -

1. Remove 130k from account to my Bank
2. No trading till CPI results are out on Tuesday. Don't want to gamble before CPI
3. Put 25k in a slow AF ETF stock (so that I can continue to day trade) and option trade with the remaining 25k

# **Dow closes nearly 170 points higher, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq post worst week since December: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/09/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 eked out a narrow gain in Friday’s session but still had the worst week in nearly two months.
*****
&gt; The broad index was up just 0.2% to end the session at 4,090.46. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.61% to close at 11,718.12. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 169.39 points, or 0.5%, to end at 33,869.27.
*****
&gt; Despite the Dow’s Friday gain, it still ended the week down 0.17%. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lost 1.11% and 2.41%, respectively, in what was their worst week since December.
*****
&gt; Investors digested the most recent interest rate hike, economic data and recent commentary from Federal Reserve speakers, said Shana Sissel, founder of Banríon Capital Management. That caused intraday moves, she said, as investors changed positions while predicting how the central bank will act on interest rates going forward.
*****
&gt; “There’s some mixed signals here, which I think is why volatility is up,” Sissel said. “There’s not really a consensus coming out with leading indicators that give you a lot of confidence of what’s coming next. And the markets hate that.”
*****
&gt; Ride-hailing platform Lyft tanked more than 36% after a disappointing fiscal fourth-quarter report. Expedia also saw its shares fall by more than 8% after its earnings and revenue fell below analysts’ expectations.
*****
&gt; Those are the latest reports in what has been considered an underwhelming quarter by Wall Street. With nearly 70% S&amp;P 500 companies reporting, around 70% of those companies beat analyst expectations for the quarter. That’s a smaller share of companies surpassing expectations than the three-year historical average of 79%, according to The Earnings Scout.

&gt; # February Monthly Options Expiration Week: DJIA, S&amp;P 500 &amp; NASDAQ Up 12 of Last 17

&gt; February’s monthly option expiration week has had a bullish tilt over the past 33 years. Weekly average gains fall in a range of 0.20% from NASDAQ to 0.49% by Russell 2000. Based upon average performance and the number of positive weeks, Russell 2000 has the best track record. Since 2006, February’s monthly expiration week has become more bullish with DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ all advancing 12 times in 17 years.

&gt; Russell 2000 remains the standout, up 13 of the last 17 with an average weekly gain of 0.94%. Covid-19 impacted performance in 2020 and 2021 and 2022’s bear market took a bite out of the week. On the heels of this week’s weakness, next week could reverse the recent losing streak provided CPI does not disappoint on Valentine’s Day.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e14351695c142c44e8ea42d57cc60aa6/934cddff19e4cec1-c5/s500x750/102c096312a62282b10a15484c007827105d2f0c.jpg))**

&gt; Jobless Claims Above Expectations

&gt; After a few weeks of declines, jobless claims rose this week coming in at 196K on a seasonally adjusted basis compared to forecasts of a more modest increase to 190K. Albeit higher, jobless claims remain at healthy levels with this week marking the fourth in a row with a sub-200K reading.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/020923-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; Before seasonal adjustments, claims are at a point of the year in which they tend to trend lower. As for the most recent reading, claims rose from 225K to 234K. As shown in the second chart below, while claims do tend to fall at this point of the year, the current week of the year (as well as next week) has been less consistent with declines only around half the time. In other words, on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, claims have flattened out a bit and should continue to be watched as that plateau is not necessarily going completely against usual seasonal patterns.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/020923-Claims-2.png))**

&gt; Continuing claims similarly rose by more than expected this week reaching 1.688 million, the highest level in a little over a month.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/020923-Claims-3.png))**

&gt; While both continuing and initial claims were higher this week, the past few months have generally seen a much more pronounced rise in the former than the latter. That marks a reversal from what was observed last year when initial claims were rising without continuing claims following suit. As a result of that move, the ratio of initial to continuing claims had surged well above what has historically been the norm, peaking in the summer. Fast forward to today, that ratio moved back below the low from early last spring to reach the lowest level since October 2020.

&gt;  # Refis Rise

&gt; Mortgage rates have come off of recent lows with the 30-year national average from Bankrate.com currently at 6.53%. While rates are not making new lows, those are much more attractive levels than last fall when they peaked well above 7%. On a rolling 3-month basis, the decline in mortgage rates continues to rank as some of the largest since the late 1990s (after the largest increase since the 1990s).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/020823-MBA-1.png))**

&gt; Given the alleviation on the rates front, purchase applications have been rebounding. The Mortgage Bankers Association's weekly purchase application index is currently 19.2% above the post-pandemic low put in place in the first week of the year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/020823-MBA-2.png))**

&gt; When rates were rising rapidly, massively stifling demand last year, refinance applications had taken a much larger hit than purchase applications. At the worst levels during the holidays, refinance applications reached the lowest level since May 2000. Since the start of the year, though, refinance applications have surged. Although there is still plenty of lost ground still to make up as applications continue to run below the past two decades' range, the 68% month-over-month increase in applications has been the largest jump since March 2020 when applications doubled. Of all weekly readings since 1990, the current one-month increase ranks in the top 5% of all month-over-month moves on record.

&gt; # Do Stocks Want the Eagles or Chiefs to Win?

&gt; “Baseball is 90% mental, the other half physical.” Yogi Berra

&gt; First things first, don’t ever invest based on who wins the Super Bowl. Or the coin toss, or how bad the refs will be, etc. With that out of the way, it is Super Bowl season and that means it is time to talk about the always-popular Super Bowl Indicator!

&gt; The Super Bowl Indicator suggests stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner has come from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team has won, stocks fall. Of course, this is totally random, but it turns out that when looking at the previous 56 Super Bowls, stocks do better when an NFC team wins the big game. But as Yogi playfully told us in the quote above, sometimes things don’t always add up, and investing on this isn’t going to add up.

&gt; This fun indicator was originally discovered in 1978 by Leonard Kopett, a sportswriter for the New York Times. Up until that point, the indicator had never been wrong.

&gt; We like to make it a little simpler and break it down by how stocks do when the NFC wins versus the AFC, ignoring the history of the franchises. As our first table shows, the S&amp;P 500 gained 10% on average during the full year when an NFC team won versus up less than 7% with an AFC team won. Now, this totally random indicator isn’t perfect, as the Rams won last year, and stocks had a horrible year. Yet another reason why the Gods should have let my Bengals win that game. I digress…

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blog-180.png))**

&gt; So, it is clear-cut that investors want the Eagles to fly high and win, right? Maybe not. As stocks have gained the full year 10 of the past 11 times when a team from the AFC won the championship. In fact, the only time stocks were lower was in 2015, when the full year ended down -0.7%, so virtually flat.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blog-290.png))**

&gt; By my math, there have been 56 Super Bowls and 22 different winners. I broke things up by franchise and city. For instance, Baltimore has won three championships, with one from the Colts and two for the Ravens. So I differentiated the two. Then the Colts won one in Indy, so I broke that out as well. Either way, I still don’t see my Bengals on here, but I expect that the change next year in Vegas at the Super Bowl in February 2024.

&gt; Getting to the two teams in it this year, the Chiefs have won twice and stocks gained 8.5%, about average, while when the Eagles won in 2018, stocks finished lower for the year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-375.png))**

&gt; Speaking of Philly championships, here was a fun one we shared during the World Series. Turns out, very bad things happened when the City of Brotherly Love won the World Series. I’m talking panics, depressions, recessions, and financial crises. Maybe we shouldn’t be rooting for Philly now?

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-446.png))**

&gt; Perhaps investors have been looking at it all wrong though?

&gt; It might not matter who wins, but by how much they win. I was looking at the data and noted the Bengals lost by only three last year to the Rams, and stocks did poorly. Then I saw that some years with lopsided scores had some great market returns and vice versa. Well, wouldn’t you know it? The larger the size of the win, the better stocks do. (Let’s have another disclosure that nearly everything I’m saying here isn’t in any way, shape, or form related to what stocks actually do, and you shouldn’t use it as such)

&gt; That’s right, when it is a single-digit win in the Super Bowl, the S&amp;P 500 is up less than 5% on average and higher less than 60% of the time. A double-digit win? Things jump to about 11% and 79%. And wouldn’t you know it, when the final score is three touchdowns or more, the S&amp;P 500 gained 13.6% for the year and is higher about 85% of the time.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blog-567.png))**

&gt; Here’s a list of all the big blowouts and what happened to stocks those years. Not too bad, huh?

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blog-610.png))**

&gt; Here are ten other takeaways I noticed while slicing and dicing the data:
&gt; * The NFC has won 29 Super Bowls and the AFC 27.
&gt; * The Steelers and Pats have won the most at six.
&gt; * As great as Peyton Manning was, he only won one Super Bowl. His brother won two.
&gt; * The NFC won two in a row and hasn’t won three in a row since the Saints, Packers, and Giants in 2010, 2011, and 2012.
&gt; * The NFC won 13 in a row from 1985 (Bears) until 1997 (Packers).
&gt; * The Bills made the Super Bowl four consecutive years, losing each time.
&gt; * The highest-scoring game was 75 total points in 1995 between the 49ers and Chargers.
&gt; * The lowest-scoring game was only 16 points in 2019 when the Pats beat the Rams.
&gt; * The closest ever was a one-point win for the Giants over the Bills in 1993 (the Scott Norwood game).
&gt; * In 1990 the 49ers beat the Broncos by 45 for the largest win ever.
&gt; * So, there you have it, your complete breakdown for the big game. I’m saying the Eagles, as they have the best offensive and defensive lines. But Mahomes and Chiefs are awesome, and it’ll likely be a great game. In the end, I just hope the refs don’t ruin it with bad calls all against one team like they did in the AFC Championship. Make it an even game for both teams, Zebras!

*Past performance is not an indication or guarantee of future results.*

&gt; # Five Clues This Isn’t Just a Bear Market Rally

&gt; “When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?” John Maynard Keynes

&gt; Stocks are off to a roaring start to 2023, which has many claiming this is just a bear market rally and one that will likely end with new lows. Carson Investment Research has quietly been taking the other side to these vocal bears, saying many times that October was likely the end of the bear market and that better times were potentially in the cards. In fact, we upgraded our view on equities to overweight from neutral in late December and added equity risk to the models we run for our Partners as a result.

&gt; Two big reasons for our optimism are that we don’t see a recession this year, and everyone is bearish. Regarding the macro outlook, last week’s 517k jobs number does little to change our stance. Additionally, I’ve done this for a long time, and I’ve never quite seen everyone as bearish as they were late last year. Remember, the crowd is rarely right, as we discussed in Is Anyone Bullish?

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is up 17% from the October lows, the same magnitude as the 17% rally we saw last summer. Back then, stocks rolled back over and made new lows, something most strategists on tv are saying will happen again.

&gt; Well, the facts are changing for us, and as Keynes told us in the quote above, we had better change our minds as well. So here are five clues that this rally is on firmer footing and will likely continue.

&gt; # The Trendline
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 finally broke above the bearish trendline from 2022. As you can see below, each time this trendline was touched, stocks sold off, usually hard. However, this time, stocks broke above the trendline and accelerated higher, a clear change in trend. Not to mention, the S&amp;P 500 also moved significantly above the 200-day moving average, which clues that the trend has changed.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blog-142.png))**

&gt; # More stocks are going up.
&gt; Even though the S&amp;P 500 is still more than 10% away from a new all-time high, we are seeing more and more stocks making new 52-week highs, yet another sign that this rally, indeed, is different. As you can see below, the first part of last year saw less and less stocks making new highs, a potential warning sign under the surface. Well, today is near 180, with more and more stocks breaking out to the upside. With more stocks strong, the likelihood that the overall indexes follow is potentially quite high.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blog-25.png))**

&gt; # Wider breadth and participation
&gt; Another clue that more and more stocks are trending higher is that more than 70% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are above their 200-day moving average. This is mostly since late 2021; in other words, more participation than any time we saw last year. As the chart below shows, when this gets above 65%, it signals a potential shift to a stronger trending market. For example, we saw this above 65% for much of the bull market of 2021. Once this broke beneath 65% in late 2021, it was a warning sign of potential trouble brewing.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-344.png))**

&gt; # High beta is doing better.
&gt; We saw leadership from things like utilities, healthcare, and staples this time a year ago. In other words, the defensive part of the market. Today we are seeing those groups underperform, with high-beta names doing well, another clue that this rally is on better footing. So let’s sum it up like this, you don’t want the defensive stuff leading to a proper healthy bull market.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-476.png))**

&gt; # The Golden Cross
Lastly, a rare technical development took place last week on the S&amp;P 500, as the 50-day moving average moved above the slower-trending 200-day moving average. This development is known as a “Golden Cross,” which has tended to resolve bullishly for stocks.

&gt; Since 1950, there have been 36 other Golden Crosses on the S&amp;P 500 and the future returns have been strong, with the S&amp;P 500 higher a year later nearly 78% of the time and up 10.7% on average, with a median return of close to 13%. The bottom line is that this is another sign that things appear to be improving more than anytime we saw last year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blog-570.png))**

&gt; Taking it a step further, historically, this Golden Cross took place nearly 13% away from all-time highs. We looked, and when Golden Crosses happened more than 10% or more away from new highs, the future returns got better. Higher a year later, 15 out of 16 times (93.8%) and up a very solid 15.7% on average is something most bulls would likely take, I’m sure.

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks. :)",18,3,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning February 13th, 2023 Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 13th, 2023.

# **Dow closes nearly 170 points higher, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq post worst week since December: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/09/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 eked out a narrow gain in Friday’s session but still had the worst week in nearly two months.
*****
&gt; The broad index was up just 0.2% to end the session at 4,090.46. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.61% to close at 11,718.12. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 169.39 points, or 0.5%, to end at 33,869.27.
*****
&gt; Despite the Dow’s Friday gain, it still ended the week down 0.17%. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lost 1.11% and 2.41%, respectively, in what was their worst week since December.
*****
&gt; Investors digested the most recent interest rate hike, economic data and recent commentary from Federal Reserve speakers, said Shana Sissel, founder of Banríon Capital Management. That caused intraday moves, she said, as investors changed positions while predicting how the central bank will act on interest rates going forward.
*****
&gt; “There’s some mixed signals here, which I think is why volatility is up,” Sissel said. “There’s not really a consensus coming out with leading indicators that give you a lot of confidence of what’s coming next. And the markets hate that.”
*****
&gt; Ride-hailing platform Lyft tanked more than 36% after a disappointing fiscal fourth-quarter report. Expedia also saw its shares fall by more than 8% after its earnings and revenue fell below analysts’ expectations.
*****
&gt; Those are the latest reports in what has been considered an underwhelming quarter by Wall Street. With nearly 70% S&amp;P 500 companies reporting, around 70% of those companies beat analyst expectations for the quarter. That’s a smaller share of companies surpassing expectations than the three-year historical average of 79%, according to The Earnings Scout.

&gt; # February Monthly Options Expiration Week: DJIA, S&amp;P 500 &amp; NASDAQ Up 12 of Last 17

&gt; February’s monthly option expiration week has had a bullish tilt over the past 33 years. Weekly average gains fall in a range of 0.20% from NASDAQ to 0.49% by Russell 2000. Based upon average performance and the number of positive weeks, Russell 2000 has the best track record. Since 2006, February’s monthly expiration week has become more bullish with DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ all advancing 12 times in 17 years.

&gt; Russell 2000 remains the standout, up 13 of the last 17 with an average weekly gain of 0.94%. Covid-19 impacted performance in 2020 and 2021 and 2022’s bear market took a bite out of the week. On the heels of this week’s weakness, next week could reverse the recent losing streak provided CPI does not disappoint on Valentine’s Day.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e14351695c142c44e8ea42d57cc60aa6/934cddff19e4cec1-c5/s500x750/102c096312a62282b10a15484c007827105d2f0c.jpg))**

&gt; Jobless Claims Above Expectations

&gt; After a few weeks of declines, jobless claims rose this week coming in at 196K on a seasonally adjusted basis compared to forecasts of a more modest increase to 190K. Albeit higher, jobless claims remain at healthy levels with this week marking the fourth in a row with a sub-200K reading.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/020923-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; Before seasonal adjustments, claims are at a point of the year in which they tend to trend lower. As for the most recent reading, claims rose from 225K to 234K. As shown in the second chart below, while claims do tend to fall at this point of the year, the current week of the year (as well as next week) has been less consistent with declines only around half the time. In other words, on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, claims have flattened out a bit and should continue to be watched as that plateau is not necessarily going completely against usual seasonal patterns.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/020923-Claims-2.png))**

&gt; Continuing claims similarly rose by more than expected this week reaching 1.688 million, the highest level in a little over a month.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/020923-Claims-3.png))**

&gt; While both continuing and initial claims were higher this week, the past few months have generally seen a much more pronounced rise in the former than the latter. That marks a reversal from what was observed last year when initial claims were rising without continuing claims following suit. As a result of that move, the ratio of initial to continuing claims had surged well above what has historically been the norm, peaking in the summer. Fast forward to today, that ratio moved back below the low from early last spring to reach the lowest level since October 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/020923-Claims-4.png))**

&gt;  # Refis Rise

&gt; Mortgage rates have come off of recent lows with the 30-year national average from Bankrate.com currently at 6.53%. While rates are not making new lows, those are much more attractive levels than last fall when they peaked well above 7%. On a rolling 3-month basis, the decline in mortgage rates continues to rank as some of the largest since the late 1990s (after the largest increase since the 1990s).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/020823-MBA-1.png))**

&gt; Given the alleviation on the rates front, purchase applications have been rebounding. The Mortgage Bankers Association's weekly purchase application index is currently 19.2% above the post-pandemic low put in place in the first week of the year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/020823-MBA-2.png))**

&gt; When rates were rising rapidly, massively stifling demand last year, refinance applications had taken a much larger hit than purchase applications. At the worst levels during the holidays, refinance applications reached the lowest level since May 2000. Since the start of the year, though, refinance applications have surged. Although there is still plenty of lost ground still to make up as applications continue to run below the past two decades' range, the 68% month-over-month increase in applications has been the largest jump since March 2020 when applications doubled. Of all weekly readings since 1990, the current one-month increase ranks in the top 5% of all month-over-month moves on record.

&gt; # Do Stocks Want the Eagles or Chiefs to Win?

&gt; “Baseball is 90% mental, the other half physical.” Yogi Berra

&gt; First things first, don’t ever invest based on who wins the Super Bowl. Or the coin toss, or how bad the refs will be, etc. With that out of the way, it is Super Bowl season and that means it is time to talk about the always-popular Super Bowl Indicator!

&gt; The Super Bowl Indicator suggests stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner has come from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team has won, stocks fall. Of course, this is totally random, but it turns out that when looking at the previous 56 Super Bowls, stocks do better when an NFC team wins the big game. But as Yogi playfully told us in the quote above, sometimes things don’t always add up, and investing on this isn’t going to add up.

&gt; This fun indicator was originally discovered in 1978 by Leonard Kopett, a sportswriter for the New York Times. Up until that point, the indicator had never been wrong.

&gt; We like to make it a little simpler and break it down by how stocks do when the NFC wins versus the AFC, ignoring the history of the franchises. As our first table shows, the S&amp;P 500 gained 10% on average during the full year when an NFC team won versus up less than 7% with an AFC team won. Now, this totally random indicator isn’t perfect, as the Rams won last year, and stocks had a horrible year. Yet another reason why the Gods should have let my Bengals win that game. I digress…

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blog-180.png))**

&gt; So, it is clear-cut that investors want the Eagles to fly high and win, right? Maybe not. As stocks have gained the full year 10 of the past 11 times when a team from the AFC won the championship. In fact, the only time stocks were lower was in 2015, when the full year ended down -0.7%, so virtually flat.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blog-290.png))**

&gt; By my math, there have been 56 Super Bowls and 22 different winners. I broke things up by franchise and city. For instance, Baltimore has won three championships, with one from the Colts and two for the Ravens. So I differentiated the two. Then the Colts won one in Indy, so I broke that out as well. Either way, I still don’t see my Bengals on here, but I expect that the change next year in Vegas at the Super Bowl in February 2024.

&gt; Getting to the two teams in it this year, the Chiefs have won twice and stocks gained 8.5%, about average, while when the Eagles won in 2018, stocks finished lower for the year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-375.png))**

&gt; Speaking of Philly championships, here was a fun one we shared during the World Series. Turns out, very bad things happened when the City of Brotherly Love won the World Series. I’m talking panics, depressions, recessions, and financial crises. Maybe we shouldn’t be rooting for Philly now?

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-446.png))**

&gt; Perhaps investors have been looking at it all wrong though?

&gt; It might not matter who wins, but by how much they win. I was looking at the data and noted the Bengals lost by only three last year to the Rams, and stocks did poorly. Then I saw that some years with lopsided scores had some great market returns and vice versa. Well, wouldn’t you know it? The larger the size of the win, the better stocks do. (Let’s have another disclosure that nearly everything I’m saying here isn’t in any way, shape, or form related to what stocks actually do, and you shouldn’t use it as such)

&gt; That’s right, when it is a single-digit win in the Super Bowl, the S&amp;P 500 is up less than 5% on average and higher less than 60% of the time. A double-digit win? Things jump to about 11% and 79%. And wouldn’t you know it, when the final score is three touchdowns or more, the S&amp;P 500 gained 13.6% for the year and is higher about 85% of the time.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blog-567.png))**

&gt; Here’s a list of all the big blowouts and what happened to stocks those years. Not too bad, huh?

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blog-610.png))**

&gt; Here are ten other takeaways I noticed while slicing and dicing the data:
&gt; * The NFC has won 29 Super Bowls and the AFC 27.
&gt; * The Steelers and Pats have won the most at six.
&gt; * As great as Peyton Manning was, he only won one Super Bowl. His brother won two.
&gt; * The NFC won two in a row and hasn’t won three in a row since the Saints, Packers, and Giants in 2010, 2011, and 2012.
&gt; * The NFC won 13 in a row from 1985 (Bears) until 1997 (Packers).
&gt; * The Bills made the Super Bowl four consecutive years, losing each time.
&gt; * The highest-scoring game was 75 total points in 1995 between the 49ers and Chargers.
&gt; * The lowest-scoring game was only 16 points in 2019 when the Pats beat the Rams.
&gt; * The closest ever was a one-point win for the Giants over the Bills in 1993 (the Scott Norwood game).
&gt; * In 1990 the 49ers beat the Broncos by 45 for the largest win ever.
&gt; * So, there you have it, your complete breakdown for the big game. I’m saying the Eagles, as they have the best offensive and defensive lines. But Mahomes and Chiefs are awesome, and it’ll likely be a great game. In the end, I just hope the refs don’t ruin it with bad calls all against one team like they did in the AFC Championship. Make it an even game for both teams, Zebras!

*Past performance is not an indication or guarantee of future results.*

&gt; # Five Clues This Isn’t Just a Bear Market Rally

&gt; “When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?” John Maynard Keynes

&gt; Stocks are off to a roaring start to 2023, which has many claiming this is just a bear market rally and one that will likely end with new lows. Carson Investment Research has quietly been taking the other side to these vocal bears, saying many times that October was likely the end of the bear market and that better times were potentially in the cards. In fact, we upgraded our view on equities to overweight from neutral in late December and added equity risk to the models we run for our Partners as a result.

&gt; Two big reasons for our optimism are that we don’t see a recession this year, and everyone is bearish. Regarding the macro outlook, last week’s 517k jobs number does little to change our stance. Additionally, I’ve done this for a long time, and I’ve never quite seen everyone as bearish as they were late last year. Remember, the crowd is rarely right, as we discussed in Is Anyone Bullish?

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is up 17% from the October lows, the same magnitude as the 17% rally we saw last summer. Back then, stocks rolled back over and made new lows, something most strategists on tv are saying will happen again.

&gt; Well, the facts are changing for us, and as Keynes told us in the quote above, we had better change our minds as well. So here are five clues that this rally is on firmer footing and will likely continue.

&gt; # The Trendline
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 finally broke above the bearish trendline from 2022. As you can see below, each time this trendline was touched, stocks sold off, usually hard. However, this time, stocks broke above the trendline and accelerated higher, a clear change in trend.

&gt; Even though the S&amp;P 500 is still more than 10% away from a new all-time high, we are seeing more and more stocks making new 52-week highs, yet another sign that this rally, indeed, is different. As you can see below, the first part of last year saw less and less stocks making new highs, a potential warning sign under the surface.

&gt; # High beta is doing better.
&gt; We saw leadership from things like utilities, healthcare, and staples this time a year ago. In other words, the defensive part of the market. Today we are seeing those groups underperform, with high-beta names doing well, another clue that this rally is on better footing. So let’s sum it up like this, you don’t want the defensive stuff leading to a proper healthy bull market.

We looked, and when Golden Crosses happened more than 10% or more away from new highs, the future returns got better. Higher a year later, 15 out of 16 times (93.8%) and up a very solid 15.7% on average is something most bulls would likely take, I’m sure.

Below are my notes for the speech. The inflation number likely doesn't include today's CPI.

This is a very good breakdown of how the Fed views inflation, and how they factor it into their rate hike decision going forward. I'd highly encourage people to read this if you need a primer on the current outlook for inflation.

I've highlighted notable quotes below. She also talked about financial condition, and the market's still trying to analyze what financial condition metrics the Fed monitors. This is because of Powell's comments of ""financial conditions have been steady"" when most financial condition metrics by the market show considerable loosening.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, there has been some progress on inflation in recent months. But the question for monetary policy is not whether there has been some progress, but rather **whether the progress will continue**. **Will inflation return all the way to our 2 percent target, and will it sustainably remain there over time**?

for the last three months of 2022, **headline PCE inflation slowed to an annualized rate of 2.1 percent**. However, **a good bit of that drop in inflation was due to falling prices of oil and other commodities**. **Energy prices**, as measured by the PCE price index for energy goods and services, **fell at a 16 percent annual rate over the last three months of 2022**. But while it’s a relief to see lower prices at the gas pump, **energy prices can’t keep falling at this rate forever.**

**Core inflation**, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, has **historically been a better guide to where overall inflation will go in the future**. And core PCE inflation was nearly 3 percent annualized for the last three months of 2022, which is significantly higher than the inflation rate the public is counting on us to deliver. ""

**we can break down core inflation into a few more pieces**: core goods, which includes items like cars and clothing; housing services, such as rent; and core services excluding housing. **This last category makes up about half of personal consumption** and includes everything from health care to transportation to entertainment.

**Core goods prices fell at a 3 percent annual rate in the last three months of 2022, partially offsetting rapid increases in services prices**. Goods prices dropped in part because supply chains were recovering from the disruptions of the pandemic. Supply chains can’t recover twice, so **I don’t see 3 percent deflation in core goods as sustainable**. It seems more likely that core goods inflation will move up to the prepandemic trend of zero or a bit below, which means we’ll need lower services inflation to sustain 2 percent inflation overall.

Because rents adjust infrequently as leases turn over, i**t takes time for a cooler housing market to translate into lower measures of housing inflation**. Housing inflation was still around 9 percent annualized for the last three months of 2022. But our research at the Dallas Fed suggests that housing inflation should peak later this year.

The larger concern is with services other than housing. **Core services inflation excluding housing has been running in a range of 4 to 5 percent for close to two years, with little sign of improvement**. You could say this is the core of the inflation problem.

**If core services inflation excluding housing remained in its current range**, while other categories returned to their prepandemic pace, **total inflation going forward would settle much closer to 3 percent** than to our 2 percent goal. And **depending on how the U.S. and world economies evolve, inflation could be even higher**. For example, the Dallas Fed’s business contacts tell us that **China’s rapid transition out of zero-COVID policies could drive up commodity prices this year** by more than what most people currently expect.

But in addition, because **services prices depend substantially on labor costs**, the outlook for sustainably **returning inflation to 2 percent hinges in large part on what happens in the labor market.**

on average over the past half-year, the **economy has added 350,000 jobs a month, which is still very high**.

Another sign of strength in the labor market is that as of December, t**here were 1.9 job openings for every unemployed person** in the United States. That is **down only slightly from the all-time high of two openings per unemployed person** last March. And it is **well above the ratio of 1.2 openings per unemployed person in 2019—which was thought at the time to be a very strong labor market.**

strong labor market has been driving up **wages, which have been growing at an annual rate of about 4.5 to 5 percent** by a variety of measures.

Over time, to be **able to buy more goods and services with their wages,** workers taken together must produce more goods and services. In other words, **labor productivity must rise**.

In the long run, **if companies’ profit margins**—or, more precisely, capital’s share of income—are **stable, the growth rate of prices will equal the growth rate of wages minus the growth rate of labor productivity.**

Falling profit margins could also conceivably contribute to lower inflation in the short run.

But for **5 percent wage growth to be consistent with 2 percent inflation** on a sustained basis, **productivity would have to rise at a 3 percent annual rate. Yet output per hour worked grew at an annual rate of only 1 and a quarter percent from 2012 through 2019, and there is little indication it has accelerated meaningfully since then**.

Absent a dramatic rise in productivity, it seems likely that sustainably returning inflation to 2 percent will require substantially lower wage growth. That may take time. Respondents to the **Dallas Fed’s Texas Business Outlook Surveys expect more than 5 percent wage growth in 2023,** which is down significantly from what they saw in 2022 but still quite elevated. Wage pressures have moderated somewhat in the latest national reports on average hourly earnings and employment costs

**To achieve better balance, labor supply will have to increase, or labor demand will have to decrease**

Labor supply has been weak coming out of the pandemic. **Early retirements, deaths and lingering illness from the pandemic have reduced the supply of workers**. So have structural challenges like the l**ack of child care for working parents**. And **immigration fell to nearly zero during the pandemic, though it has since bounced back sharply**. Beyond that, employers tell me that when workers are available, they often **lack the necessary training or skills**.

Both of these tools **push up interest rates for consumers and companies** throughout the economy. Financial conditions have, therefore, tightened significantly. The 10-year nominal **Treasury yield has risen about 2 percentage points, and mortgage rates have risen nearly 3 percentage points**, since the start of 2022. Importantly, in recent months, **real medium-term interest rates as measured by the yields on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities have averaged above 1.5 percent. That is a significantly restrictive level given that most estimates suggest the neutral real interest rate is below 1 percent**

The **most important risk I see is that if we tighten too little, the economy will remain overheated and we will fail to keep inflation in check**. That could trigger a self-fulfilling spiral of unanchored inflation expectations that would be very costly to stop.

when **central banks aren’t sufficiently proactive in addressing high inflation**, the **road back to price stability is longer, the labor market is weaker, and the scars on the economy can last long after inflation is finally reduced**. We must stay focused on bringing inflation back to target in a sustainable and timely way

At the same time, if **we tighten too much or too fast, we risk seeing the labor market weaken much more than is necessary to control inflation.** Those job losses would be very costly, too, particularly for lower-income households.

**we shouldn’t lock in on a peak interest rate or a precise path of rates**

The **evidence I’m looking for to gain confidence in the inflation outlook** includes some **further and sustained improvement in the inflation statistics**, as well as a clear change in the underlying factors—like the **imbalance of aggregate supply and demand and resulting very tight labor market**—that have been producing high inflation. And I think we need to see the **economy evolving more or less as forecasts predict. When inflation repeatedly comes in higher than the forecasts, as it did last year, or when the jobs report comes in with hundreds of thousands more jobs than anyone expected, as happened a couple weeks ago, it is hard to have confidence in any outlook**.

I will also remain attentive to financial conditions. Ultimately, **financial conditions need to be sufficiently restrictive to restore price stability**. We must remain **prepared to continue rate increases for a longer period than previously anticipated, if such a path is necessary to respond to changes in the economic outlook or to offset any undesired easing in conditions**. And **even after we have enough evidence that we don’t need to raise rates at some future meeting, we’ll need to remain flexible and tighten further if changes in the economic outlook or financial conditions call for it.**",119,32,"Fed Lorie Logan: “Supply chains can’t recover twice, so I don’t see 3% deflation in core goods as sustainable.” Fed Logan's giving a speech on inflation today.

This was an incredibly deflationary period and inflation was at historic lows. To combat the deflationary spiral from the GFC, monetary and fiscal policy was loose, interest rates were 0%, and economic growth was stimulated. This resulted in a bull market in equities that took off and ran for the next decade.

Once the recovery was certain, global central banks began quantitative tightening measures in 2016 and had intended to normalize interest rates after the 2010's spurred the greatest economic recovery after the global financial crisis of 2008. This policy stopped in 2019 during the U.S./China trade war and then reversed in 2020. OGs remember October - December 2018 and how Yellen spooked the market with interest rate hikes.

The 2020's began with a global pandemic that originated in China and spread across the world, killing millions of people. This forced central banks to abandon their quantitative tightening policies to stop the global economy from plunging into a deep depression caused by the global pandemic. ZIRP was re-introduced along with a multitude of monetary and fiscal policies to stimulate economic growth during the pandemic. We avoided a generational depression.

In 2022, central banks began resuming their quantitative tightening policies that they first began in 2016 through 2018. Inflation had begun to rise aggressively in 2021 and central banks acted to tame inflation.

In 2023, both bond markets and stock markets were expecting inflation to drop quickly back down and for zero interest rates policies to return (ZIRP). It wasn't until the end of 2023 that bond and stock markets realized that the era of ZIRP and TINA (There Is No Alternative) was over and that interest rates would remain perpetually higher in this environment of entrenched inflation and subdued economic growth.

The Fed will NOT bring back ZIRP. Why? Because ZIRP is contingent upon inflation being low and inflation is NOT low. Please let go of the delusion that the easy money train is coming back. It left. And if you missed this once in a lifetime opportunity to make millions of dollars, then unfortunately you probably never will.

This reality might be starting to sink in for investors after the most recent CPI and PPI reports, which showed that inflation is either entrenched or starting to rise again. Either way, this means that interest rates are going higher and staying longer.

Central banks are attempting to unwind their balance sheets as well. Nobody wants to buy these assets on their books right now and so rates will continue to climb until a point where the Fed can offload these bonds to institutions that will buy them. This is simple demand destruction for assets and a forced reduction of liquidity for capital markets. As the Fed balance sheet draws down...so too shall the stonk market.

By 2024 I'm expecting that economists and pundits will begin to make the term ""post-growth economics"" begin trending and everyone will start talking about what this means for equity investors. We have also had a public push for ""equity"" and ""wealth redistribution"". These things will affect the appetite for stocks.

The US economy is extremely robust and this will actually work against equity investors since there will not be a severe recession, but growth will be severely crippled. When looking at labor participation rates, an aging population, and the cost of capital increasing, this does not paint a pretty picture for the future returns of stocks.

Equities will continue a protracted bear market because investors no longer need to accept the risk profile of equities. Bond yields are - and will continue to become - more attractive.

Taxes will also have to be raised and the rich along with corporations will be the logical target for tax rate hikes. This isn't political, it's just a logical conclusion based upon the facts.

Public companies will have to raise their dividend payouts to compete for shareholders against bond yields. Stock buybacks will become a thing of the past, as will frivolous IPO cash grabs and SPAC frenzies.

Crypt-doh bros and girls are going to lose everything because imaginary digital coins were an ""asset"" that ONLY did well in a ZIRP environment. As I mentioned earlier that is never coming back unless we find ourselves 1) in an era of perpetually low interest rates and 2) find ourselves also entering an economic contraction. DO NOT buy this digital trash as you will lose everything.

Be very careful about your individual financial needs and take calculated risks. The era of foolishly gambling money because everything it literally going up is over and probably not coming back. Find Alpha where you can but do not be complacent or reckless. Many people will lose everything over the next few years as the market comes to grips with this paradigm shift.

I didn't even address the risk of a U.S. Default which is still a possibility. Regardless of the outcome of the debt limit in the short term, JPow has reiterated that the U.S. will need to have a reckoning with respect to its path of financial solvency. Again, assuming that we raise the debt ceiling, the cost of capital will continue to increase and an era of business and government austerity will become an eventuality.

Tread carefully.

TLDR: nothing has changed with respect to the terminal path of monetary policy for the United States. We were already on this path before Covid-19 popped up and there was a once in a lifetime opportunity to make millions with this massive liquidity explosion. However, now that ship has sailed and we will continue on the path of removing liquidity and normalizing interest rates for a post-growth economy in the 2020s and beyond.",12,31,"A warning: why the 2020s will become known as a ""lost decade"" for global equities and crypt-doh while bonds enter a golden age.

113z6o4,2023-02-16 19:44:04,wallstreetbets,emb59523,ARCH: A Black Diamond,"  

**TLDR** – Arch Resources (**ARCH**) is a Coalmine Owner-Operator currently valued at only 2.5x earnings compared to peers Peabody (BTU) at 3.5x and Consol (CEIX) at 4.5x earnings. This company is kicking off crazy earnings numbers and forecasts support continued strong earnings. I don’t think that level of cash generation is currently wrapped into the price. The name is a consensus buy by all the banks and has 90%+ of institutional ownership. Hedge funds are taking new positions in the company frequently and I believe they see the same thing. The relatively under-the-radar nature of this sector makes price discovery a somewhat slow and tricky process. I believe this company should be trading close to $200/ share, which would bring it close to 3x earnings. Earnings were reported today which they crushed on (explains the price runup) but I believe there is meaningful upside as a short-to-mid-term trade to get exposure to both the energy transition play, and the industrial / building boom we’re expected to see with electrification.

Bad timing to write this given today’s runup in the name, but given you guys like buying things that are already at all-time-highs, hear me out.

&amp;#x200B;

Energy has been a huge trade over the last year, there’s been murmuring about the trade being done, all the juice being squeezed out of it. Maybe, but Texas Tea’s ugly cousin still looks cheap. I’m talking about coal. Obviously coal is one of the most ethically deplorable things out there, or at least that’s how it’s portrayed in the media, but how are we supposed to arrive at “Net Zero” without use of cheap, transitional energy sources like coal, especially ones that have other uses (steelmaking). Out of all the energy sectors, coal is one of the cheapest from a valuation standpoint, trading at only 2-5x earnings, which is INSANE given the amount of cashflow these guys are kicking off. The company that looks most promising – ARCH. Arch Resources owns and operates coal mines primarily in the great US of A. Arch enjoys one of the lowest cost positions in the country on Metallurgical Coal, which is used for steelmaking. Arch also produces Thermal coal in a lower proportion. Coal has seen a runup in price over the last couple years and some of that has reverted to the mean, but Coal has room to keep running. Some of the mitigating factors: supply chain / manufacturing is still getting up to speed post the ‘vid, and China reopening is still a wildcard, as they’re the world’s biggest purchaser of coal (China produces roughly half of the world’s steel). If China continues their return to normal as expected, I believe the runway will bust wide open. Side note for you out there who like to make crayon drawings on charts, relative strength is at 82 as of today.

&amp;#x200B;

Arch management has been in the game for a long time, they know coal isn’t our future, so they’re strategically spending their money in ways that make sense – you can see this in their uses of cash. They’re spending on inventories as the demand for coal and energy broadly is experiencing its’ time in the sun, but they aren’t incessantly throwing money at growth Capex – only enough to keep their assets maintained and productive (look at depreciation and Capex lines below). They also know that the broader coal production industry has been under-investing in coal-producing assets which can only be a good thing for ARCH as they will be ready to capitalize on improved market dynamics related to the supply-demand of coal.

Let’s talk about risks – only fitting as the company exited bankruptcy protection in 2016 after the metallurgical coal market saw a turn in its’ fortunes following one of the best times in recent history. Keep in mind that ARCH had a whopping $5 BILLION of debt at that point. Arch now carries a very low amount of debt given their level of earnings – currently having more cash ($236mm) than debt ($174mm) which is in line with their business plan. Rule of thumb is for high business risk companies (physical asset intensive, cyclical) companies to not carry a lot of financial risk, or leverage. You’ll notice below is the excessive interest coverage levels (EBITDA / Interest Expense) of 10.7x. This company’s not going anywhere and you can stress earnings levels all you want – there’s plenty of wiggle room.

Finally, what is going to cause value recognition to take place? There needs to be a catalyst. Firstly, most of the ownership in the stock has been sitting in the name for quite some time. ARCH has had upwards of 80%+ institutional ownership for years. The company is currently creating value over and above its cost of capital and I don’t believe that’s fully been recognized in the price yet, especially not after today’s earnings. This may not happen overnight, but I’m convinced this is a winner. The stock currently has a 7.7% dividend on it. I’m glad getting paid to wait.

It’s hard to say how long price discovery takes in names like this. It doesn’t trade with crazy high volume, but it also isn’t a penny stock – this thing has fairly liquid, and somewhat cheap options (!!) and is a months to a year long play in my view. Leaves some room for some interesting stock / option trades.

Disclaimer: This is not investment advice. I have a current long position in ARCH (own the stock).",3,7,"ARCH: A Black Diamond   

**TLDR** – Arch Resources (**ARCH**) is a Coalmine Owner-Operator currently valued at only 2.5x earnings compared to peers Peabody (BTU) at 3.5x and Consol (CEIX) at 4.5x earnings. This company is kicking off crazy earnings numbers and forecasts support continued strong earnings. I don’t think that level of cash generation is currently wrapped into the price. The name is a consensus buy by all the banks and has 90%+ of institutional ownership. Hedge funds are taking new positions in the company frequently and I believe they see the same thing. The relatively under-the-radar nature of this sector makes price discovery a somewhat slow and tricky process. I believe this company should be trading close to $200/ share, which would bring it close to 3x earnings. Earnings were reported today which they crushed on (explains the price runup) but I believe there is meaningful upside as a short-to-mid-term trade to get exposure to both the energy transition play, and the industrial / building boom we’re expected to see with electrification.

Bad timing to write this given today’s runup in the name, but given you guys like buying things that are already at all-time-highs, hear me out.

Energy has been a huge trade over the last year, there’s been murmuring about the trade being done, all the juice being squeezed out of it. Maybe, but Texas Tea’s ugly cousin still looks cheap. I’m talking about coal. Obviously coal is one of the most ethically deplorable things out there, or at least that’s how it’s portrayed in the media, but how are we supposed to arrive at “Net Zero” without use of cheap, transitional energy sources like coal, especially ones that have other uses (steelmaking). Out of all the energy sectors, coal is one of the cheapest from a valuation standpoint, trading at only 2-5x earnings, which is INSANE given the amount of cashflow these guys are kicking off. The company that looks most promising – ARCH. Arch Resources owns and operates coal mines primarily in the great US of A. Arch enjoys one of the lowest cost positions in the country on Metallurgical Coal, which is used for steelmaking. Arch also produces Thermal coal in a lower proportion. Coal has seen a runup in price over the last couple years and some of that has reverted to the mean, but Coal has room to keep running. Some of the mitigating factors: supply chain / manufacturing is still getting up to speed post the ‘vid, and China reopening is still a wildcard, as they’re the world’s biggest purchaser of coal (China produces roughly half of the world’s steel). If China continues their return to normal as expected, I believe the runway will bust wide open. Side note for you out there who like to make crayon drawings on charts, relative strength is at 82 as of today.

Arch management has been in the game for a long time, they know coal isn’t our future, so they’re strategically spending their money in ways that make sense – you can see this in their uses of cash. They’re spending on inventories as the demand for coal and energy broadly is experiencing its’ time in the sun, but they aren’t incessantly throwing money at growth Capex – only enough to keep their assets maintained and productive (look at depreciation and Capex lines below). They also know that the broader coal production industry has been under-investing in coal-producing assets which can only be a good thing for ARCH as they will be ready to capitalize on improved market dynamics related to the supply-demand of coal.

*****
&gt; U.S. stocks were mixed on Friday as stubbornly high inflation and a rebound in rates continued to weigh on investor sentiment.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 129.84 points, or 0.39% to end at 33,826.69. The 30-stock index rallied from lows of the day boosted by shares of Amgen and United Health, which gained 2.69% and 2.41% respectively.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 shed 0.28% to end the day at 4,079.09, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.58% to close at 11,787.27. Energy was the biggest laggard. Devon Energy dropped 4.29%, dragging down the S&amp;P 500.
*****
&gt; Stocks are mixed on the week. The Dow ended down 0.13% for the week, its third negative week in a row — a first since September. The S&amp;P 500 has shed 0.28% for the week, its second negative week in a row. The Nasdaq rose 0.59% on the week.
*****
&gt; Investors continue to worry about how the economy and equities will hold up as the Federal Reserve hikes rates to tame stubbornly high inflation. In a Friday speech, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said there’s a long way to go before the central bank reaches its target of 2% inflation.
*****
&gt; “We have been in a very contentious tug of war between the equity markets and the Treasury markets,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley. While Treasurys are signaling that the Fed is going to hold rates higher for longer, equities are not listening and instead looking for a soft landing.
*****
&gt; “Equity investors seem to be looking through a couple more rate hikes and looking forward to a pause,” he added.
*****
&gt; The moves came after major averages shed more than 1% on Thursday, after the Labor Department said the producer price index — an inflation metric that tracks wholesale prices — rose 0.7% last month. That was more than economists expected.
*****
&gt; Next week, investors will continue to watch earnings season for signs of consumer strength or weakness. Home Depot, Walmart and Etsy are scheduled to report results next week.

&gt; # The Valentine’s Day Indicator Sees Green In 2023

&gt; First things first, this is a three-day weekend for many of us and I hope everyone enjoys the long President’s Day weekend. And if you need to buy a mattress, this is your Super Bowl weekend, good luck out there. Speaking of the Super Bowl, this is our yearly reminder that someone should run for President, and their whole platform should be to make sure that the Super Bowl is always over President’s Day weekend. Who wouldn’t want the day after the big game off? I swear they’d win …. But I digress.

&gt; We’ve noted many times this year some of the rare yet bullish developments taking place for stocks that should continue to lead to strong performance in 2023. For example, we discussed why the strong January, amid a negative year the year before, could be a very good thing in The Trifecta of Bullish. Here’s one of the tables from that blog. Higher nine for nine and up 27% for the year would make many bulls smile.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blog-140.png))**

&gt; Let’s take another look at the strong start to 2023, but this time wrap in Valentine’s Day. I hope everyone had a nice Valentine’s Day earlier this week. Mine was a winner, as my wife got me a Reese’s Take 5 candy bar, my favorite for sure. Do you know who also had a nice Valentine’s Day? The bulls. I know, I know, Valentine’s Day is known for red; well, the Valentine’s Day Indicator is flashing green.

&gt; 2023 was the 11th-best start to a year ever for the S&amp;P 500 as of Valentine’s Day, up a very impressive 7.7%. What happened next, looking at the best ten starts to a year? Nine out of 10 times the rest of the year was green, with an average return of nearly 11% and a median return of 12.5% – both well above the average returns. Momentum can be a wonderful thing for investors, and the Valentine’s Day Indicator does little to change that.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-271.png))**

&gt; Speaking of momentum, here’s an interesting study I did when stocks gained more than 5% during a month (like what happened in January). A year later? Stocks are up 13.5% on average and higher 83% of the time, way better than average. I also broke it up by which month the big gains took place. When January gained more than 5%, the next twelve months are up 12.8% on average and higher 83.3% of the time. Maybe we should be rooting for a 5% gain in May or June, as stocks have never been lower a year later. Or maybe in September, when they gained an incredible 20% on average a year later?

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blog-562.png))**

&gt; I will leave you with this. February historically isn’t a very strong month for stocks, and it is the second half of February when trouble tends to arrive. We are still quite optimistic about how well stocks could do the rest of 2023, but it won’t be a straight line. Just be aware that the next three or four weeks historically aren’t very strong, and some well-deserved seasonal weakness could be perfectly normal and healthy.

&gt;  # Up 7 of Last 11 After Presidents’ Day But Still Weak Long Term

&gt; DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are all up 7 of the last 11 years on the day after the Presidents’ Day market holiday with average changes ranging from -0.12% for DJIA to 0.24% for NASDAQ. In our February 2023 Strategy Calendar for members shows conflicting indications for this Tuesday, February 21, the day after Presidents’ Day. Over the most recent 21-year history this 15th trading of February has been down 61.9% of the time for S&amp;P 500 with average loss of -0.29% earning the day our “Angry Bear” icon.

&gt; Earlier this week noted the improving trend of market performance ahead of Presidents’ Day weekend. As you can see in the table here the days after has improved the past 11 years but the Wednesday after has not enjoyed the same turnaround and both days still display a fair amount of red. Since 1990, Tuesday after Presidents’ Day has been strongest for the S&amp;P 500 with 18 gains and 15 losses for median gain of 0.09% but with an average loss of –0.24%. DJIA also has more gains than losses on the Tuesday after, but NASDAQ is a net loser down 20 of 33 years with an average loss of –0.51% and a median loss of –0.30%.

&gt; Wednesday is all red for all three major averages. NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 have more losses, but DJIA is a loser as well. On the Wednesday after the Presidents’ Day holiday DJIA is down 17 of 33 with an average loss of –0.10% and a median decline of –0.10%. S&amp;P 500 is down 20 of 33, average –0.08%, median –0.10% and NASDAQ is down 19 of 33, average –0.11%, median –0.18%.

&gt; Big losses two days just before and after President’s Day 2022 fueled by the escalation of belligerent rhetoric and military buildups right before Russia invaded Ukraine have worsened the record. Prior to the invasion the market was already dropping in the face of hot inflation and expectations of coming aggressive Fed rate hikes.

&gt; # American Consumers: Have Money, Will Spend

&gt; “American Consumers: Have money, will spend“

&gt; That, in a nutshell, is the story of the economy right now.

&gt; Retail sales and food services surged 3% in January, making a mockery of expectations for a 1.7% gain. This is the largest monthly increase since March 2021, but that came on the back of stimulus checks. So excluding the 2020/2021 recovery period (when we saw large drops and gains), you have to go back to October 2001 to find a month with larger gains. And even that was a rebound after a depressed September.

&gt; Such a large number should immediately get your antennae up, and there certainly are seasonality issues. For three years, we’ve seen retail sales drop in December only to surge in January.

&gt; # But don’t miss the big picture: consumption is running strong
Vehicle sales were the big driver, accounting for over a third of the overall gain. But there was broad strength everywhere, including general merchandise stores, e-commerce, clothing stores, and even furnishings (despite the slowdown in housing activity).

&gt; Spending at restaurants and bars rose by a whopping 7.2%, and it wasn’t because of prices (up 0.6% last month).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blog-2023-02-16-retail-sales-breadown.png))**

&gt; “Real” retail sales and food services, i.e., after adjusting for inflation, rose 2.4% in January. It’s currently running 9% above the pre-pandemic trend. Make all the seasonality-related adjustments you want—no denying that consumption is strong. The only surprise really is how strong goods consumption is running, even as we get further away from the pandemic. The expectation was that consumption patterns would normalize by now, and goods spending would head back towards trend.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blog-2023-02-16-real-income-growth-1168x1600.png))**

&gt; # Consumption is strong because real incomes are rising
It really doesn’t get much simpler than that.

&gt; January is a great example. Aggregate weekly payrolls, which should give you a sense of income earned by private workers across the economy, rose 1.5% in January. This was on the back of:

&gt; Rising employment (remember the massive jobs report?)
&gt; * More hours worked
&gt; * Strong wage growth

&gt; Meanwhile, inflation was up “only” 0.5%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blog-2023-02-16-weekly-payroll-growth-vs-inflation-1169x1600.png))**

&gt; After adjusting for prices, aggregate payrolls have now been rising since last June at an annualized pace of almost 5%. For perspective, this measure of aggregate income ran at an annual pace of just over 2% before the pandemic.

&gt; The current pace is hot, to put it mildly, so don’t be surprised if we get a pullback. But if employment continues to rise, wage growth remains strong, and inflation doesn’t surge, real incomes should continue trending higher. And that’s a tailwind for consumption and the economy.

&gt; Of course, the other side of solid consumption is that many of the categories where we see strong consumer spending are seeing upward price pressures. I wrote about this after the January inflation report was released – the fact that inflation is running hot in several service sectors and core goods like apparel and furnishings is another indication that demand is strong, especially in those areas.


&gt; # Good news is good news, finally
Hot inflation in the service sector is precisely what the Federal Reserve is worried about. So, it isn’t a surprise that markets have repriced their expectations for monetary policy, now taking the Fed at their word that they’ll get to the 5.0-5.25% range for the federal funds rate. And stay there for longer.

&gt; That repricing is not great for bonds, but unlike last year, the good news is that stocks have held up quite strong in the face of that. This is positive in that good news about the economy is good news for stocks.

&gt; # Bulls Step Back

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 hasn't moved decisively in any direction over the past week, and as a result, sentiment saw little change. 34.1% of respondents to the weekly AAII sentiment survey reported as bullish this week, down from a high of 37.5% last week.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/021623-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; Bearish sentiment took from those bullish losses as the reading rose up to 28.8% from 25%. Even though that is a higher reading, it is still the only other reading below 30% since last March.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/021623-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; Additionally, the pickup in bearish sentiment was not enough to make bears outnumber bulls. As such, the bull-bear spread saw its first back-to-back positive readings since November 2021.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/021623-AAII-3.png))**

&gt; Although over a third of respondents reported as bullish, this week's predominant sentiment level was neutral. 37.1% reported as such this week. That reading has now been above its historical average of 31.4% for seven straight weeks; the longest streak since January 2021.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/021623-AAII-4.png))**

&gt; Other sentiment surveys have likewise taken more optimistic tones lately despite a modest pullback in bullish sentiment this week. Factoring in the Investors Intelligence and NAAIM sentiment readings, our sentiment composite remains positive but is off from its short-term peak last week.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/021623-AAII-5.png))**

&gt; # Claims Still Below 200K

&gt; Jobless claims continue to impress in the new year. For the fifth week in a row, seasonally adjusted initial claims have come in with a sub-200K reading. That is the longest streak since a 10 week long stretch ending in April of last year. Although claims have remained at a healthy level, there hasn't been much in the way of improvement over the last few weeks with claims yet to move below the 183K low at the end of January.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/021623-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, the first few months of the year tends to see a sharp unwind in claims, albeit with some moderation during the current week of the year which is being observed currently with fairly flat readings in claims over the past few weeks. At current levels, this year's reading was roughly in line with the comparable week of the past several years with the exception of the much more elevated reading in 2021.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/021623-Claims-2.png))**

&gt; While not to say the reading is at unhealthy levels, continuing claims have not been as strong as initial claims. Claims have risen in each of the past two weeks, totaling 1.696 million in the most recent print. That is the highest level since the week of December 24th. Overall, both initial and continuing claims continue to show healthy readings without much in the way of rapid improvement or deterioration.

&gt; # NFIB Nuances

&gt; This morning's release of the NFIB's survey of small business sentiment showed only a modest rebound. Whereas the index was expected to rise from 89.8 up to 91, the index only rose to 90.3. Albeit higher sequentially and off the lows from last fall, the January reading also remains below the worst levels from the onset of COVID.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/021423-NFIB-1.png))**

&gt; In addition to optimism remaining weak, the most recent month also saw a surge in economic policy uncertainty. Rising 5 points month over month to 76, that index is at the highest level since July 2021 and saw its biggest one month jump since last July.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/021423-NFIB-2.png))**

&gt; Looking across the individual components of the report, breadth was mixed with six of the ten inputs into the headline optimism number moving higher while the other four fell. Multiple categories—in addition to the headline index—are in the bottom decile of their historical ranges. As we discussed in today's Morning Lineup, while in aggregate some aspects of the report remain weak, there is some nuance. In general, this month's report saw improvement in categories measuring realized changes (i.e. actual earnings changes, actual sales changes, actual employment changes, etc.) while expectations were much worse (i.e. plans to make capital outlays, plans to increase inventories, etc.). In other words, small businesses appear to have pessimistic outlooks contrary to reporting actual improvements in their businesses.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/021423-NFIB-3.png))**

&gt; The employment situation showcases that divergence between actual changes and plans. Hiring plans remain at the low end of the pandemic range even after a slight rebound versus the December reading. Meanwhile, compensation plans have plummeted to a new low and the weakest level since April 2021. That was in spite of actual employment changes showing net hirings at the highest level since March 2020 with a coincident uptick in compensation to the highest level in six months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/021423-NFIB-4.png))**

&gt; Albeit on net more firms are seeing declines rather than increases, this month also saw an improvement in actual sales and earnings. Part of that change is likely thanks to alleviation in inflation as the higher prices index hit a new post-high low of 42. In turn, the percentage of respondents reporting now as a good time to expand has modestly recovered. With that said, sales expectations continued to reverse lower after peaking two months ago.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/021423-NFIB-5.png))**

&gt; As for expenditure indices, again the dichotomy of plans and actual changes is apparent. While plans experienced a 13th percentile month over month decline to the low end of its pandemic range, reported capital expenditures have surged with a top decile month over month reading. In fact, that sharp rise during the month of January resulted in the joint highest reading of the post pandemic period (March and May 2021 saw identical readings).

&gt; Meanwhile, plans to increase inventories are rapidly declining. The index for inventory accumulation has now reached the lowest level since 2009. However, even though inventories are rapidly declining, businesses on net report satisfaction with current inventory levels. Following the very high readings in inventory satisfaction earlier in the pandemic (meaning on net a higher percentage of respondents reported inventories were too low), the huge drop in inventory accumulation would indicate some supply/demand mismatches are working themselves out; likely in part thanks to weakening sales.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/021423-NFIB-6.png))**

&gt; Turning back to capital expenditures, the NFIB also surveys on what these small businesses are spending their money on. January saw a broad uptick across categories with the exception of furniture or fixtures.

# **Dow closes more than 100 points higher on Friday, but notches third straight week of losses on rate fears: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/16/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
&gt; U.S. stocks were mixed on Friday as stubbornly high inflation and a rebound in rates continued to weigh on investor sentiment.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 129.84 points, or 0.39% to end at 33,826.69. The 30-stock index rallied from lows of the day boosted by shares of Amgen and United Health, which gained 2.69% and 2.41% respectively.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 shed 0.28% to end the day at 4,079.09, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.58% to close at 11,787.27. Energy was the biggest laggard. Devon Energy dropped 4.29%, dragging down the S&amp;P 500.
*****
&gt; Stocks are mixed on the week. The Dow ended down 0.13% for the week, its third negative week in a row — a first since September. The S&amp;P 500 has shed 0.28% for the week, its second negative week in a row. The Nasdaq rose 0.59% on the week.
*****
&gt; Investors continue to worry about how the economy and equities will hold up as the Federal Reserve hikes rates to tame stubbornly high inflation. In a Friday speech, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said there’s a long way to go before the central bank reaches its target of 2% inflation.
*****
&gt; “We have been in a very contentious tug of war between the equity markets and the Treasury markets,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley. While Treasurys are signaling that the Fed is going to hold rates higher for longer, equities are not listening and instead looking for a soft landing.
*****
&gt; “Equity investors seem to be looking through a couple more rate hikes and looking forward to a pause,” he added.
*****
&gt; The moves came after major averages shed more than 1% on Thursday, after the Labor Department said the producer price index — an inflation metric that tracks wholesale prices — rose 0.7% last month. That was more than economists expected.
*****
&gt; Next week, investors will continue to watch earnings season for signs of consumer strength or weakness. Home Depot, Walmart and Etsy are scheduled to report results next week.

&gt; # The Valentine’s Day Indicator Sees Green In 2023

&gt; First things first, this is a three-day weekend for many of us and I hope everyone enjoys the long President’s Day weekend. And if you need to buy a mattress, this is your Super Bowl weekend, good luck out there. Speaking of the Super Bowl, this is our yearly reminder that someone should run for President, and their whole platform should be to make sure that the Super Bowl is always over President’s Day weekend. Who wouldn’t want the day after the big game off? I swear they’d win …. But I digress.

&gt; We’ve noted many times this year some of the rare yet bullish developments taking place for stocks that should continue to lead to strong performance in 2023. For example, we discussed why the strong January, amid a negative year the year before, could be a very good thing in The Trifecta of Bullish. Here’s one of the tables from that blog. Higher nine for nine and up 27% for the year would make many bulls smile.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blog-140.png))**

&gt; Let’s take another look at the strong start to 2023, but this time wrap in Valentine’s Day. I hope everyone had a nice Valentine’s Day earlier this week. Mine was a winner, as my wife got me a Reese’s Take 5 candy bar, my favorite for sure. Do you know who also had a nice Valentine’s Day? The bulls. I know, I know, Valentine’s Day is known for red; well, the Valentine’s Day Indicator is flashing green.

&gt; 2023 was the 11th-best start to a year ever for the S&amp;P 500 as of Valentine’s Day, up a very impressive 7.7%. What happened next, looking at the best ten starts to a year? Nine out of 10 times the rest of the year was green, with an average return of nearly 11% and a median return of 12.5% – both well above the average returns. Momentum can be a wonderful thing for investors, and the Valentine’s Day Indicator does little to change that.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-271.png))**

&gt; Speaking of momentum, here’s an interesting study I did when stocks gained more than 5% during a month (like what happened in January). A year later? Stocks are up 13.5% on average and higher 83% of the time, way better than average. I also broke it up by which month the big gains took place. When January gained more than 5%, the next twelve months are up 12.8% on average and higher 83.3% of the time. Maybe we should be rooting for a 5% gain in May or June, as stocks have never been lower a year later. Or maybe in September, when they gained an incredible 20% on average a year later?

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blog-562.png))**

&gt; I will leave you with this. February historically isn’t a very strong month for stocks, and it is the second half of February when trouble tends to arrive. We are still quite optimistic about how well stocks could do the rest of 2023, but it won’t be a straight line. Just be aware that the next three or four weeks historically aren’t very strong, and some well-deserved seasonal weakness could be perfectly normal and healthy.

&gt;  # Up 7 of Last 11 After Presidents’ Day But Still Weak Long Term

&gt; DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are all up 7 of the last 11 years on the day after the Presidents’ Day market holiday with average changes ranging from -0.12% for DJIA to 0.24% for NASDAQ. In our February 2023 Strategy Calendar for members shows conflicting indications for this Tuesday, February 21, the day after Presidents’ Day. Over the most recent 21-year history this 15th trading of February has been down 61.9% of the time for S&amp;P 500 with average loss of -0.29% earning the day our “Angry Bear” icon.

&gt; Earlier this week noted the improving trend of market performance ahead of Presidents’ Day weekend. As you can see in the table here the days after has improved the past 11 years but the Wednesday after has not enjoyed the same turnaround and both days still display a fair amount of red. Since 1990, Tuesday after Presidents’ Day has been strongest for the S&amp;P 500 with 18 gains and 15 losses for median gain of 0.09% but with an average loss of –0.24%. DJIA also has more gains than losses on the Tuesday after, but NASDAQ is a net loser down 20 of 33 years with an average loss of –0.51% and a median loss of –0.30%.

&gt; Wednesday is all red for all three major averages. NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 have more losses, but DJIA is a loser as well. On the Wednesday after the Presidents’ Day holiday DJIA is down 17 of 33 with an average loss of –0.10% and a median decline of –0.10%. S&amp;P 500 is down 20 of 33, average –0.08%, median –0.10% and NASDAQ is down 19 of 33, average –0.11%, median –0.18%.

&gt; Big losses two days just before and after President’s Day 2022 fueled by the escalation of belligerent rhetoric and military buildups right before Russia invaded Ukraine have worsened the record. Prior to the invasion the market was already dropping in the face of hot inflation and expectations of coming aggressive Fed rate hikes.

&gt; # American Consumers: Have Money, Will Spend

&gt; “American Consumers: Have money, will spend“

&gt; That, in a nutshell, is the story of the economy right now.

&gt; Retail sales and food services surged 3% in January, making a mockery of expectations for a 1.7% gain. This is the largest monthly increase since March 2021, but that came on the back of stimulus checks. So excluding the 2020/2021 recovery period (when we saw large drops and gains), you have to go back to October 2001 to find a month with larger gains. And even that was a rebound after a depressed September.

&gt; Such a large number should immediately get your antennae up, and there certainly are seasonality issues. For three years, we’ve seen retail sales drop in December only to surge in January.

&gt; # But don’t miss the big picture: consumption is running strong
Vehicle sales were the big driver, accounting for over a third of the overall gain. But there was broad strength everywhere, including general merchandise stores, e-commerce, clothing stores, and even furnishings (despite the slowdown in housing activity).

&gt; Spending at restaurants and bars rose by a whopping 7.2%, and it wasn’t because of prices (up 0.6% last month).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blog-2023-02-16-retail-sales-breadown.png))**

&gt; “Real” retail sales and food services, i.e., after adjusting for inflation, rose 2.4% in January. It’s currently running 9% above the pre-pandemic trend. Make all the seasonality-related adjustments you want—no denying that consumption is strong. The only surprise really is how strong goods consumption is running, even as we get further away from the pandemic. The expectation was that consumption patterns would normalize by now, and goods spending would head back towards trend.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blog-2023-02-16-real-income-growth-1168x1600.png))**

&gt; # Consumption is strong because real incomes are rising
It really doesn’t get much simpler than that.

&gt; January is a great example. Aggregate weekly payrolls, which should give you a sense of income earned by private workers across the economy, rose 1.5% in January. This was on the back of:

&gt; Rising employment (remember the massive jobs report?)
&gt; * More hours worked
&gt; * Strong wage growth

&gt; Meanwhile, inflation was up “only” 0.5%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blog-2023-02-16-weekly-payroll-growth-vs-inflation-1169x1600.png))**

&gt; After adjusting for prices, aggregate payrolls have now been rising since last June at an annualized pace of almost 5%. For perspective, this measure of aggregate income ran at an annual pace of just over 2% before the pandemic.

&gt; The current pace is hot, to put it mildly, so don’t be surprised if we get a pullback. But if employment continues to rise, wage growth remains strong, and inflation doesn’t surge, real incomes should continue trending higher. And that’s a tailwind for consumption and the economy.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blog-2023-02-16-real-sales-1200x1600.png))**

&gt; Of course, the other side of solid consumption is that many of the categories where we see strong consumer spending are seeing upward price pressures. I wrote about this after the January inflation report was released – the fact that inflation is running hot in several service sectors and core goods like apparel and furnishings is another indication that demand is strong, especially in those areas.


&gt; # Good news is good news, finally
Hot inflation in the service sector is precisely what the Federal Reserve is worried about. So, it isn’t a surprise that markets have repriced their expectations for monetary policy, now taking the Fed at their word that they’ll get to the 5.0-5.25% range for the federal funds rate. And stay there for longer.

&gt; That repricing is not great for bonds, but unlike last year, the good news is that stocks have held up quite strong in the face of that. This is positive in that good news about the economy is good news for stocks.

&gt; # NFIB Nuances

&gt; This morning's release of the NFIB's survey of small business sentiment showed only a modest rebound. Whereas the index was expected to rise from 89.8 up to 91, the index only rose to 90.3. Albeit higher sequentially and off the lows from last fall, the January reading also remains below the worst levels from the onset of COVID.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/021423-NFIB-1.png))**

&gt; In addition to optimism remaining weak, the most recent month also saw a surge in economic policy uncertainty. Rising 5 points month over month to 76, that index is at the highest level since July 2021 and saw its biggest one month jump since last July.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/021423-NFIB-2.png))**

&gt; Looking across the individual components of the report, breadth was mixed with six of the ten inputs into the headline optimism number moving higher while the other four fell. Multiple categories—in addition to the headline index—are in the bottom decile of their historical ranges. As we discussed in today's Morning Lineup, while in aggregate some aspects of the report remain weak, there is some nuance. In general, this month's report saw improvement in categories measuring realized changes (i.e. actual earnings changes, actual sales changes, actual employment changes, etc.) while expectations were much worse (i.e. plans to make capital outlays, plans to increase inventories, etc.). In other words, small businesses appear to have pessimistic outlooks contrary to reporting actual improvements in their businesses.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/021423-NFIB-3.png))**

&gt; The employment situation showcases that divergence between actual changes and plans. Hiring plans remain at the low end of the pandemic range even after a slight rebound versus the December reading. Meanwhile, compensation plans have plummeted to a new low and the weakest level since April 2021. That was in spite of actual employment changes showing net hirings at the highest level since March 2020 with a coincident uptick in compensation to the highest level in six months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/021423-NFIB-4.png))**

&gt; Albeit on net more firms are seeing declines rather than increases, this month also saw an improvement in actual sales and earnings. Part of that change is likely thanks to alleviation in inflation as the higher prices index hit a new post-high low of 42. In turn, the percentage of respondents reporting now as a good time to expand has modestly recovered. With that said, sales expectations continued to reverse lower after peaking two months ago.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/021423-NFIB-5.png))**

&gt; As for expenditure indices, again the dichotomy of plans and actual changes is apparent. While plans experienced a 13th percentile month over month decline to the low end of its pandemic range, reported capital expenditures have surged with a top decile month over month reading. In fact, that sharp rise during the month of January resulted in the joint highest reading of the post pandemic period (March and May 2021 saw identical readings).

&gt; Meanwhile, plans to increase inventories are rapidly declining. The index for inventory accumulation has now reached the lowest level since 2009. However, even though inventories are rapidly declining, businesses on net report satisfaction with current inventory levels. Following the very high readings in inventory satisfaction earlier in the pandemic (meaning on net a higher percentage of respondents reported inventories were too low), the huge drop in inventory accumulation would indicate some supply/demand mismatches are working themselves out; likely in part thanks to weakening sales.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/02/021423-NFIB-6.png))**

&gt; Turning back to capital expenditures, the NFIB also surveys on what these small businesses are spending their money on. January saw a broad uptick across categories with the exception of furniture or fixtures.

That's it folks. Data is in, and we're going back to where we were. 



I'm not gonna say indices are going to hit all time lows or even dip 30% but I'm certain in the next 45 days they will fall down at least 10%. 


If we look at indices when ~~crayon eating apes~~ people believed that terminal rate would be near 550 BPS or 600 we had indices around 10-20% lower. And now that's back with certainty. We are a lot closer to it than we were all the way back in December. It's like indices fell throughout 2022 for nothin. It was for a fucking good reason. I mentioned earlier in the year that there was de-globalization therefore inflation would be sticky. And with a shrinking market during QT we would have a great stagflation. I did say that... May have been drunker than I am now... but I did warn you. 


What did the markets do? Run every single fucking stock higher! Like nothing happened! And no QT?! Motherfucker money supply is shrinking, what do you think is gonna happen to asset valuations when there is less moneys? I don't know how much more I can dumb this down. All of you bulls are bagholders. If you realized gains and got lucky, good job. Now stay on the sidelines or short the fuck out of the market because we are only going one way and that's DOWN! 


Fed is reducing balance sheet and will continue to increase interests and so will every other central bank. You think this pump is happening because of ya'lls' bets? Someone is gonna get margin called soon and dominoes will fall. 


I'm not even gonna get into NSC's derailments. Look at the guidance and earnings from railways companies in the last quarter; Same with banks and rest of finance. There isn't anything rosy or peachy. This ship is going down and you're still getting drunk on the deck. Wake up and realize what the hell is going to happen when FOMC ends and you all stare at the screen with your mouths wide open. Guidance will surprise delusional bulls for sure and it'll be too late. Do you think anyone in their right mind will buy calls before FOMC? I fucking dare you. Get some calls before FOMC and post it. Orders from China had slowed down even before the new year. Railways reported decrease in volume before the new year. Money supply has been decreasing and interests have been increasing. 


It's nothing new. JPow always made it clear that they will monitor data and make decisions accordingly. So don't act like nobody told you so. You're all delusional and hyped for no reason. 


This isn't the time to be a bull. Go ahead and reverse me. I've shorted QQQ, SPY, and DIA 10%-15% from January highs into April and July. 


DXY is already up, bonds are trading higher, what do you think is gonna happen to your papers when institutions leave you with your bags. There is a huge disconnect between earnings, outlook and stock prices. 


This is my last warning. 

TL:DR It's Friday Night and I'm a bit tipsy... felt like being charitable and share my wisdom. Puts on most indices.

119ka38,2023-02-23 01:21:03,investing,iminfornow,How will monetary policy change when inflation is under control?,"What do you think will happen?

This is my take on the situation:  
Inflation went from transitionary to entrenched quite suddenly last year as an argument to start raising interest rates. These terms seem to be defined by how they're resolved: entrenched inflation is solved by monetary policy while transitionary inflation isn't, instead of describing a specific phenomenon. Using that definition we can call Turkey's inflation transitionary as well.

So let's ignore these terms and try to get a better picture of fundamental and temporary causes for the inflation we experience:

1. international transport is completely disrupted by a pandemic
2. huge sums of money are injected in the economy
3. two years into recovery a war completely disrupts the energy and commodity markets

Each of these triggers causes an acute mismatch between demand and supply. Combined they start cause a ripple effect that seems to result in a feedback loop. We don't know if the loop stops when the initial stimuli fade so the decision is made to raise interest rates.

But when do we lower interest rates again? Should this happen as soon as possible or only if inflation goes below our target? What is the perfect rate? 0? Is it realistic we go back to the pre-2020 situation?

&amp;#x200B;

From what I understand central banks raise the interest rates by selling bonds and not releasing that money back to the economy. This reduces the money supply in the economy, and available to buy goods - reducing demand. It should take 6-12 months for this effect to fully materialize.

I don't really get why it works like this and how sure we are this is what happening. I appreciate the elegance using such a simple adjustment and let the system just run its course, but I can't imagine it not being possible to micromanage the system a little more and achieving a way more precise and direct result using taxation.",3,7,"How will monetary policy change when inflation is under control?

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose Thursday as traders weigh earnings from chipmaker Nvidia and assess future potential Federal Reserve moves.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 105 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.5%, and Nasdaq-100 futures jumped 0.9%.
*****
&gt; Nasdaq futures got a boost from Nvidia, which rose more than 8% on better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings and revenue.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is coming off its fourth straight losing session, dropping 0.2% on Wednesday. The Dow also fell, while the Nasdaq Composite posted a small gain.
*****
&gt; The moves came after the Federal Reserve released the minutes of its most recent meeting, which concluded Feb. 1, showing that members of the central bank are resolved to keep fighting inflation with rate hikes.
*****
&gt; Inflation “remained well above” the Fed’s 2% target and the labor market “remained very tight, contributing to continuing upward pressures on wages and prices,” according to the minutes.
*****
&gt; “The Fed is determined to free up some slack in the labor market, to ensure that inflation doesn’t get entrenched at its current high level,” said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank. “By mid-2023, year-over-year CPI inflation likely will have slowed to below the federal funds rate. But if inflation surprises to the upside again, or if the unemployment rate falls further, the Fed could hike more than in our forecast.”
*****
&gt; More consumer earnings reports are due out Thursday morning, including Alibaba, Papa John’s, Wayfair and Bath &amp; Body Works. After the bell, investors will hear from Beyond Meat, Block, Warner Bros. Discovery and Carvana, among others.
*****
&gt; In economic data, traders are looking forward to the latest GDP and weekly jobless claims data, which are both scheduled to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET Thursday.
*****
&gt; Additionally, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic will speak at an event hosted by the Atlanta Fed Thursday morning. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly will take part in a fireside chat in the afternoon.

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose Thursday as traders weigh earnings from chipmaker Nvidia and assess future potential Federal Reserve moves.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 105 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.5%, and Nasdaq-100 futures jumped 0.9%.
*****
&gt; Nasdaq futures got a boost from Nvidia, which rose more than 8% on better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings and revenue.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is coming off its fourth straight losing session, dropping 0.2% on Wednesday. The Dow also fell, while the Nasdaq Composite posted a small gain.
*****
&gt; The moves came after the Federal Reserve released the minutes of its most recent meeting, which concluded Feb. 1, showing that members of the central bank are resolved to keep fighting inflation with rate hikes.
*****
&gt; Inflation “remained well above” the Fed’s 2% target and the labor market “remained very tight, contributing to continuing upward pressures on wages and prices,” according to the minutes.
*****
&gt; “The Fed is determined to free up some slack in the labor market, to ensure that inflation doesn’t get entrenched at its current high level,” said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank. “By mid-2023, year-over-year CPI inflation likely will have slowed to below the federal funds rate. But if inflation surprises to the upside again, or if the unemployment rate falls further, the Fed could hike more than in our forecast.”
*****
&gt; More consumer earnings reports are due out Thursday morning, including Alibaba, Papa John’s, Wayfair and Bath &amp; Body Works. After the bell, investors will hear from Beyond Meat, Block, Warner Bros. Discovery and Carvana, among others.
*****
&gt; In economic data, traders are looking forward to the latest GDP and weekly jobless claims data, which are both scheduled to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET Thursday.
*****
&gt; Additionally, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic will speak at an event hosted by the Atlanta Fed Thursday morning. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly will take part in a fireside chat in the afternoon.

A measure the Federal Reserve watches closely to gauge inflation rose more than expected in January, indicating the central bank has more work to do to bring down prices.

The personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy increased 0.6% for the month, and was up 4.7% from a year ago, the Commerce Department reported Friday. Wall Street had been expecting respective readings of 0.5% and 4.4%.

Including the volatile food and energy components, headline inflation increased 0.6% and 5.4% respectively.

Markets fell following the report, with futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average off more than 300 points.

Consumer spending also rose more than expected as prices increased, jumping 1.8% for the month vs. the estimate for 1.4%. Personal income increased 1.4%, higher than the 1.2% estimate. The personal saving rate also was up, rising to 4.7%.

All of the numbers suggest inflation accelerated to start the new year, putting the Fed in a position where it likely will continue to raise interest rates. The central bank has pushed benchmark rates up by 4.5 percentage points since March 2022 as inflation hit its highest level in some 41 years.

The Fed follows the PCE measures more closely than it does some of the other inflation metrics because the index adjusts for consumer spending habits, such as substituting lower-priced goods for more expensive ones. That provides a more accurate view of the cost of living.

Policymakers tend to focus more on core inflation as they believe it provides a better long-run view of inflation, though the Fed officially tracks headline PCE.

Much of January’s inflation surge came from a 2% rise in energy prices, according to Friday’s report. Food prices increased 0.4%. Goods and services both rose 0.6%.

On an annual basis, food prices rose 11.1%, while energy was up 9.6%.

Earlier Friday, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester noted in a CNBC interview that there has been some progress made but “the level of inflation is still too high.”

A nonvoting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, Mester has been pushing for more aggressive increases. She said she’s not sure if she’ll again advocate for a half percentage point boost at the March FOMC meeting.

In the wake of Friday’s data, market pricing increased for the likelihood of a half-point, or 50 basis point, increase next month, to about 33%, according to CME Group data.",932,361,"Key Fed inflation measure rose 0.6% in January, more than expected https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/24/key-fed-inflation-measure-rose-0point6percent-in-january-more-than-expected.html

WASHINGTON, March 1 (Reuters) - The United States is sounding out close allies about the possibility of imposing new sanctions on China if Beijing provides military support to Russia for its war in Ukraine, according to four U.S. officials and other sources.

The consultations, which are still at a preliminary stage, are intended to drum up support from a range of countries, especially those in the wealthy Group of 7 (G7), to coordinate support for any possible restrictions.

It was not clear what specific sanctions Washington will propose. The conversations have not been previously disclosed. The U.S. Treasury Department, a lead agency on the imposition of sanctions, declined to comment.

Washington and its allies have said in recent weeks that China was considering providing weapons to Russia, which Beijing denies. Aides to U.S. President Joe Biden have not publicly provided evidence.

They have also warned China directly against doing so, including in meetings between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping as well as during a Feb. 18 in-person meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi on the sidelines of a global security conference in Munich.

The Biden administration's initial steps to counter Chinese support for Russia have included informal outreach at the staff and diplomatic levels, including the Treasury Department, sources familiar with the matter said.

They said officials were laying the groundwork for potential action against Beijing with the core group of countries that were most supportive of sanctions imposed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine a year ago. Asked about the consultations, a White House National Security Council spokesperson said Russia's war made it difficult for China with Europe and others. ""It's a distraction for China and a potential blow to their international relationships they do not need nor should they want,"" the spokesperson said.

INTELLIGENCE
One official from a country consulted by Washington said that they had only seen scant intelligence backing up the claims about China considering possible military assistance to Russia. A U.S. official, however, said they were providing detailed accounts of the intelligence to allies.

China's role in the Russia-Ukraine war is expected to be among the topics when Biden meets with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at the White House on Friday. Before that in New Delhi on Wednesday and Thursday, the war will be discussed by foreign ministers from dozens of countries, including Russia, China and the United States.

Last week China issued a 12-point paper calling for a comprehensive ceasefire that was met with scepticism in the West. The initial outreach by Washington on sanctions has not yet led to broad agreement on any specific measures, the sources said. One source said the administration wanted to first raise the idea of coordinated sanctions and ""take pulses"" in the event that any shipments are detected to Russia from China, which declared a ""no limits"" partnership shortly before the invasion on Feb. 24 last year.

""On the G7 front, I think there is real awareness,"" a second source said, but added that detailed measures focused on China were not yet in place.

COULD CHINA TILT CONFLICT?
The Ukraine conflict has settled into grinding trench warfare. With Russia running low on munitions, Ukraine and its supporters fear that supplies from China could tilt the conflict to Russia's advantage.

As part of a related diplomatic push, Washington won language in a Feb. 24 G7 statement to mark the war's first anniversary that called on ""third-countries"" to ""cease providing material support to Russia's war, or face severe costs.""

Though the statement did not mention China by name, the U.S. imposed new penalties on people and companies accused of helping Russia evade sanctions. The measures included export curbs on companies in China and elsewhere that will block them from buying items, such as semiconductors.

""We've tried to signal very clearly, both in private in Munich, and then publicly, our concerns,"" Daniel Kritenbrink, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, told Congress this week. ""We've talked about the implications and the consequences if they were to do so. And we also know that many of our like-minded partners share those concerns.""

Among the challenges the United States faces in putting sanctions on China, the world's second-biggest economy, is its thorough integration in the major economies of Europe and Asia, complicating the talks. U.S. allies from Germany to South Korea are reticent to alienate China.

Anthony Ruggiero, a sanctions expert under former President Donald Trump, said the Biden administration does have scope for economically restricting private actors within China and that doing so could deter the government and banks from providing further support.

""Then the administration can send messages to China in public and in private, with the latter being more explicit, that the U.S. will escalate the sanctions to include targeting Chinese banks with the full range of available options,"" said Ruggiero, now with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies group.

From Mercury News article by Grace Hase, March 4, 2023

“A gallon of milk, a dozen eggs, a loaf of bread, a pound of chicken: That may be all the groceries some Californians can buy each month with their CalFresh benefits now that emergency federal pandemic funds that boosted food benefits have ended.

The severance comes at a time when Californians are already reeling from inflation and the high cost of groceries, leaving local food bank leaders in fear of a “food cliff” as demand soars and their budgets tighten.

The federal food program, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, received boosts throughout the pandemic as Americans faced furloughs and layoffs and dipped into their savings. But that emergency aid has come to an end, and eligible households will lose at least $95 a month in benefits, with some seeing their benefits dip to as low as $23 a month. Benefits are determined by income and household size.

Nationally, food prices increased by 13.1% between July 2021 and July 2022, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. It estimates that inflation has cut the value of SNAP increases by 76% since 2019.

For one San Jose single mother, the end of the added emergency benefits — which will have its final payout this month — brings worry, stress and a feeling of powerlessness. Her monthly grocery bill had been around $300 — typically what she was receiving in CalFresh benefits with the emergency allotments. Now, her CalFresh benefits are dropping to $38.

Adrianne, 42, who asked to be identified only by her first name, said she recently went back to school, and the emergency allotments during the pandemic have been a lifeline for her and her 7-year-old daughter. She plans to stock up with the final benefits payout but is concerned about whether she’ll be able to rely on a food bank.

“Being a full-time student, taking 15 credits every semester and being a single mom, I really don’t know if I have the time to make it to pick up free food,” she said. “I’m going to have to figure out something.”

Hundreds of thousands of Bay Area families may face similar challenges. In December 2022, roughly 256,000 households were receiving CalFresh benefits in Santa Clara, San Mateo, Alameda and Contra Costa counties, according to the California Department of Social Services. Across California, that number was nearly 3 million.

In Santa Clara and San Mateo counties, the more than 93,000 households receiving CalFresh benefits will lose approximately $16 million per month, according to Second Harvest of Silicon Valley — one of the largest food banks in the country.

As families lose the much-needed emergency benefits, food banks are bracing for an influx in demand. Throughout the pandemic, they broadened their reach as a social safety net as more people sought help — many for the first time. At the beginning of the pandemic, four in 10 people visiting food banks across the country were doing so for the first time, according to the nonprofit Feeding America.

Second Harvest of Silicon Valley — which serves residents in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties — doubled the number of people they fed when the pandemic hit, from about 250,000 clients a month to 500,000.

The nonprofit currently provides food for 460,000 people on average each month — an 80% increase from before the pandemic.
…
Second Harvest CEO Leslie Bacho said many of the federal financial resources that helped them meet the need have disappeared. At the same time, donations fell, and their food costs climbed 30%.”

That’s already led the agency to make some difficult decisions. Second Harvest typically gave out a gallon of milk to clients at food distributions. But at the beginning of the year, they reduced it to a half-gallon.

“The hard reality is we have limited resources, and the numbers are not adding up, so we’re having to take a really hard look at that,” Bacho said.

“For this to happen when inflation is high and food prices are through the roof, it’s really going to be devastating,” she said. “It’s going to be devastating not just for the families and people who need assistance, but also the food banks who are here to provide emergency assistance to people who need services. And it’s also going to be an impact on our local economy.”

11k21rf,2023-03-06 15:35:04,wallstreetbets,Financial_Pirate_261,$BOIL &amp; $KOLD DD,"Ok $BOIL hardos, I tried to post this sht on Friday, but I didn't enough karma lmao. But here it is in the wake of the 40c Natty drop this session. I'm now hard for $KOLD.

After reading that post about ""Freeport never, ever going down again"" I decided to post some of my own research. Like sure, we're all a lil' regarded, but to say that a facility that literally went kaboom will never go down again is just not really DD. So here's what I found and are my thoughts on Natty-G.

First thing before I get into the actual fundamentals is that the AUM for BOIL is off the charts, which is causing issues for the dudes running it. There are position limits on the exchange, so they are having to go to banks to get swaps to keep up with the fund interest. What does that mean? For the longest time, BOIL just tracked NG 2x, but now with such massive interest, BOIL is actually influencing the underlying contracts higher. Every day they have to go out and buy 2x the lots to make sure they aren't left holding the bag when we eventually take our own out. And I mean like hell yeah, bullish $BOIL right? But what happens when the fund has to roll? This ain't what happened in 2021, like yes you can stop out shorts, but we're talking about an actual commodity that isn't just influenced by us, it responds to actual market prices, and those prices say lower. This ain't us vs. some fund, it's us vs. everyone in the US who uses natural gas, which btw is literally everyone.

And they have to sell out and buy the next month because the contracts are for a physical commodity that is bound by month, aka if they don't sell they have to take delivery of a lotttt of actual cow farts in Louisiana. When they sell that many lots in such a short time, it ain't gonna be good. If today's price of NG tanks, the price of summer gas has to tank too because if it didn't, everyone would just buy cheap gas now, put it in storage, and just sell it in the summer. So the summer contracts will drop too. It hasn't been a problem in past months because BOIL wasn't such a large part of the market, but now, dumping that many contracts right before they expire is going to influence the whole futures market past this month (which is the largest part of their position), and that influence ain't gonna be up. Yes, they will use those funds to buy the next month and push it up, but again, we don't have the power here like we did with that retailer; the physical market will eventually tank price this summer in the face of every $BOIL position as we've already started to see today.

Ok on fundamentals, I believe that the BOIL run is basically done, had a nice little uptick Friday. But, many of y'all have been taking profit (see the far right of the chart above where total assets are dropping, so so much for hodling smh although after the rally on Friday y'all bought more, buy high sell low right?), and the final cold weather before next winter is about to hit. This means we're going to turn to injecting the gas into the ground and changing to summer pricing. What does that look like? Well, what do you do when supply is ""10"" and demand is ""8""? You store ""2"" in the ground to use in the winter when supply is still ""10"" and demand is now ""12"". But guess what, that storage space has to be there... We are at the upper range of our natural gas storage coming out of a very warm winter, meaning that before this coming summer ends, we are going to be totally full (we are producing at a record pace and the earnings releases I looked at didn't say they plan on slowing down this year). Again, I ain't the sharpest spoon in the drawer, but I know that when supply is ""10"", demand is ""8"", and you don't have anything to put your ""2"" in, price jumps off a cliff. I can repeat the example with bananas instead of numbers if that's helpful, it helped me anyways.

This probably belongs in [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing) lol, but figured I'd write down what I found before y'all take out a 5th mortgage. NG to $0, long $KOLD boys.",24,20,"$BOIL &amp; $KOLD DD Ok $BOIL hardos, I tried to post this sht on Friday, but I didn't enough karma lmao. But here it is in the wake of the 40c Natty drop this session. I'm now hard for $KOLD.

After reading that post about ""Freeport never, ever going down again"" I decided to post some of my own research. Like sure, we're all a lil' regarded, but to say that a facility that literally went kaboom will never go down again is just not really DD. So here's what I found and are my thoughts on Natty-G.

First thing before I get into the actual fundamentals is that the AUM for BOIL is off the charts, which is causing issues for the dudes running it. There are position limits on the exchange, so they are having to go to banks to get swaps to keep up with the fund interest. What does that mean? For the longest time, BOIL just tracked NG 2x, but now with such massive interest, BOIL is actually influencing the underlying contracts higher. Every day they have to go out and buy 2x the lots to make sure they aren't left holding the bag when we eventually take our own out. And I mean like hell yeah, bullish $BOIL right? But what happens when the fund has to roll? This ain't what happened in 2021, like yes you can stop out shorts, but we're talking about an actual commodity that isn't just influenced by us, it responds to actual market prices, and those prices say lower. This ain't us vs. some fund, it's us vs. everyone in the US who uses natural gas, which btw is literally everyone.

And they have to sell out and buy the next month because the contracts are for a physical commodity that is bound by month, aka if they don't sell they have to take delivery of a lotttt of actual cow farts in Louisiana. When they sell that many lots in such a short time, it ain't gonna be good. If today's price of NG tanks, the price of summer gas has to tank too because if it didn't, everyone would just buy cheap gas now, put it in storage, and just sell it in the summer. So the summer contracts will drop too. It hasn't been a problem in past months because BOIL wasn't such a large part of the market, but now, dumping that many contracts right before they expire is going to influence the whole futures market past this month (which is the largest part of their position), and that influence ain't gonna be up. Yes, they will use those funds to buy the next month and push it up, but again, we don't have the power here like we did with that retailer; the physical market will eventually tank price this summer in the face of every $BOIL position as we've already started to see today.

11l1ui8,2023-03-07 15:10:56,wallstreetbets,predictany007,Fed Chair Powell says interest rates are ‘likely to be higher’ than previously anticipated,"* Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday cautioned that interest rates are likely to head higher than central bank policymakers had expected.
* “If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes,” the central bank leader said in prepared remarks for appearances this week on Capitol Hill.
* Powell said the current trend shows that the Fed’s inflation-fighting job is not over.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday cautioned that interest rates are likely to head higher than central bank policymakers had expected.

Citing earlier data this year showing that inflation has reversed the deceleration it showed in late 2022, the central bank leader warned of tighter monetary policy ahead.

“The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,” Powell said in remarks prepared for two appearances this week on Capitol Hill. “If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes.”

Those remarks carry two implications: One, that the peak, or terminal, level of the federal funds rate is likely to be higher than the previous indication from the Fed officials, and, two, that the switch last month to a smaller quarter percentage point increase could be short-lived of inflation data continue to run hot.

In their December estimate, officials pegged the terminal rate at 5.1%. Current market pricing is a bit higher than that, in the 5.25%-5.5% areas, according to CME Group data. Powell did not specify how high he thinks rates ultimately will go.

The speech comes with markets generally optimistic that the Fed can tame inflation without running the economy into a ditch.

However, January data show that inflation as gauged by personal consumption expenditures prices — the preferred metric for policymakers — was still running at a 5.4% pace annually. That’s well above the Fed’s 2% long-run target and a shade above the December level.

Powell said the current trend shows that the Fed’s inflation-fighting job is not over.

“We have covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our tightening so far are yet to be felt. Even so, we have more work to do,” he said.

The Fed has raised its benchmark fund rate eight times over the past year to its current targeted level between 4.5%-4.75%. On its face, the funds rate sets what banks charge each other for overnight lending. But it feeds through to a multitude of other consumer debt products such as mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.

In recent says, some officials, such as Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, have indicated that they see the rate hikes coming to a close soon. However, others, including Governor Christopher Waller, have expressed concern about the recent inflation data and say tight policy is likely to stay in place.

“Restoring price stability will likely require that we maintain a restrictive stance of monetary policy for some time,” Powell said. “The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done.”

Powell noted some progress on inflation for areas such as housing.

However, he also noted “there is little sign of disinflation” when it comes to the important category of services spending excluding housing, food and energy. That is an important qualifier considering that the chairman at his post-meeting news conference in early February said the disinflationary process had begun in the economy, remarks that helped send stocks higher.

Markets mostly expect the Fed to enact a second consecutive quarter point, or 25 basis points, rate increase at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting later this month. However, traders are pricing in close to a 30% probability of a higher half-point increase, according to CME Group data.

Powell reiterated that rate decisions will be made “meeting by meeting” and will be dependent on data and their impact on inflation and economic activity, rather than a pre-set course.

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures dipped Thursday as traders continue to process comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and await key employment data.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell by 45 points, or 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures slipped 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Those moves come a day after Powell reiterated his warning message to lawmakers that the central bank may raise interest rates higher than previously anticipated. However, he emphasized that no decision has been made yet regarding the March meeting.
*****
&gt; “The market is finally coming to the realization that elevated interest rates are here to stay and the idea of a Fed pivot anytime soon is wishful thinking,” Main Street Research’s chief investment officer James Demmert said Thursday.
*****
&gt; “The global economy is more resilient than many realized, which will make inflation stickier and is extending central bankers’ terminal rate target. Inflation has come down but is nowhere near the Fed’s 2% target, so there is much work to be done given the stubborn strength of the economy and wage inflation,” he added.
*****
&gt; Investors will get more indication on the state of the economy Friday, when the U.S. government releases its monthly jobs report. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect the U.S. economy to have added 225,000 jobs in February.

Lender SVB Financial Group’s stock plummeted Thursday as it sold securities to realign its portfolio in response to higher interest rates while it manages lower deposit levels from clients who continue to spend cash. 

 The stock (ticker: SIVB ) fell 41.9% to $155.72 by late morning on Thursday. The decline, the steepest among companies in the S&amp;P 500 , put the shares on pace for their largest percentage decrease since Sept. 10, 1998, when they fell 42.3%,

Analysts shared Neutral ratings on the stock.

On Wednesday after the market closed, SVB said it sold all of its $21 billion in securities classified as available for sale, a portfolio essentially comprised of U.S. Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. It said it suffered an after-tax loss of $1.8 billion, to be recorded in the first quarter of 2023, as a result. Prices of fixed-income securities such as MBS and Treasury debt fall as interest rates go up.

 The company plans to reinvest the proceeds from the sale into shorter-term debt to take advantage of rising rates.

“The sale of substantially all of our AFS securities will enable us to increase our asset sensitivity, partially lock in funding costs, better insulate net interest income (NII) and net interest margin (NIM) from the impact of higher interest rates, and enhance profitability,” SVB said.

SVB is also raising $2.25 billion, including $500 million from private-equity firm General Atlantic and by offering $1.25 billion of convertible and common stock to investors.

SVB, parent of Silicon Valley Bank, enjoyed a bull run in 2021 as it lent to venture capitalist-backed start-ups in technology, life sciences and healthcare, and even Napa Valley wineries, in an era of low interest rates and easy money.

SVB’s stock has fallen nearly 80% from its record high in late 2021 as interest rates have increased, boosting the cost of the deposits the bank uses to fund loans. The company in its press release on Wednesday said its latest actions were partly due to expectations for a continued higher interest-rate environment and partly because deposit levels have declined.

Given the current volatile economic environment, venture-capital firms have been less willing to fund startups—a problem for SVB, which gets deposits from VC-backed start-ups that were earlier flush with cash. As of Feb. 28, SVB had client funds of $326 billion, a decline from $341 billion at the end of last year.

“What we learned over the last 12 to 24 months is that in a fast-paced rising rate environment, customer deposit dynamics are different than what we had expected,” said Chief Financial Officer Daniel Beck in a conference call with Bank of America analysts days ahead of Wednesday’s update.

“Concern over a slow-to-recover VC environment have kept us cautious on SIVB shares and potentially remains a headwind as rates stay elevated,” said D.A. Davidson analyst Gary Tenner. He rates the stock at Neutral and lowered his target for the price to $200 from $250.

Wedbush’s David Chiaverini maintained a Neutral stance as well. The analyst said his rating is based on SIVB’s growth normalizing after an exceptional run “and our belief that the VC market could remain challenged for the next couple quarters.”

SVB company said it now expects growth in loans in the high single digits for the full 2023 fiscal year, compared with the double-digit growth it had forecast earlier.",283,119,"SVB Financial Stock Plummets After Lender Liquidates Portfolio, Cuts Outlook [https://www.barrons.com/articles/svb-financial-stock-portfolio-outlook-loss-93287f3d](https://www.barrons.com/articles/svb-financial-stock-portfolio-outlook-loss-93287f3d?mod=hp_LATEST)

Shares of tech-focused bank SVB Financial plunged by 60% on Thursday after the company announced a plan to raise more than $2 billion in capital to help offset losses on bond sales. Trading on the stock was halted for volatility multiple times during the session, and the drop brought SVB’s market cap below $7 billion. The steepest single day drop in the companies history. 

The company said in a [letter](https://s201.q4cdn.com/589201576/files/doc_downloads/2023/03/r/Q1-2023-Investor-Letter.FINAL-030823.pdf) from CEO Greg Becker on Wednesday that it has sold “substantially all” of its available-for-sale securities and was looking to raise $2.25 billion between common equity and convertible preferred shares. The sale of securities will result in a post-tax earnings loss of $1.8 billion.

The company said in a presentation that it sold off [$21 billion](https://s201.q4cdn.com/589201576/files/doc_downloads/2023/03/Q1-2023-Mid-Quarter-Update-vFINAL3-030823.pdf) in available-for-sale securities. The available-for-sale securities at the end of the fourth quarter were mostly U.S. Treasury's, according to a securities filing. The company also previously reported more than $90 billion in held-to-maturity securities.

The bank cited higher interest rates and “elevated cash burn from our clients” as reasons to raise the new capital. The firm is heavily involved with startup companies, saying on its website that nearly half of all venture-backed tech and life science firms in the U.S. bank with SVB.

The dramatic decline for SVB comes shortly after cryptocurrency-focused bank Silvergate announced liquidation plans. SVB said in its letter that it has minimal exposure to crypto.

**The lender’s problems stemmed partly from age-old banking risks such as concentration and matching assets and liabilities**

Silvergate Capital  was in the newfangled business of cryptocurrency banking. But it  ran into some very old banking problems—which could rattle investors in  traditional lenders, too.

The California bank said Wednesday that it intends to wind down and plans to return all deposits. Though Silvergate’s customers were once cryptocurrency exchanges  such as Coinbase Global and FTX, its core banking activity was actually  quite familiar: holding deposits of ordinary dollars from those  customers and investing in government-backed securities. And therein  lies the concerning part for bank investors.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5lndut5watma1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5a1321c4f8f09d4fd350cebc44db03487a3d43e1

Unlike some bank failures of recent memory, Silvergate didn’t  have bad assets in the sense of risky loans or complex derivatives. In  fact, its assets were mostly unassailable things like U.S. Treasurys and  agency mortgage-backed securities. But credit risk—or the risk of not  being paid back—isn’t the only kind of risk banks face. Securities such  as these carry interest-rate risk.

So **when rates surged as the Federal Reserve hiked in 2022,  Treasurys and mortgage bonds plunged in price**. Now if a bank is able to hold on to these securities until they mature,  it doesn’t ultimately lose anything. **The problem comes if a bank needs  to sell them before maturity, crystallizing the losses in their market  value. Silvergate has said it had to sell securities amid its deposit outflows**.

Banks can plan for this risk by aiming to match the duration of  their liabilities, which includes deposits, to their assets. For  example, if a bank is getting funding via a one-year certificate of  deposit, it can buy a Treasury maturing in one year to match. But if a  bank’s deposits can move at any moment, it has to weigh that risk when  investing.

A bank could just keep all its money in cash. But to earn more,  banks need to take more risk. They can manage this by building up a mix  of deposits that don’t all move or reprice at once. This is done by  diversifying across customer and account types, or by adding term  deposits such as CDs. Banks also diversify with assets that are floating  rate, like many kinds of corporate loans or credit card loans.

So most banks aren’t subject to risks of a single industry such  as crypto. Having so much of its funding coming from similar types of  depositors turned out to be one of Silvergate’s biggest risks. But there  are still echoes across banking. For one, the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corp. reports that banks had unrealized losses on securities of about $620 billion as of the fourth quarter. Plus, banks’ deposits are starting to move more quickly,  and against the backdrop of the Fed’s aggressive rate increases and the  unusual postpandemic economy, it isn’t clear exactly what their  ultimate velocity will be. Notably, valuable deposits on which banks don’t pay any interest have been declining.

Banks generally have a number of sources of liquidity and have  diversified over time. Few are at risk of needing to wind down so  quickly. But many may still have to take actions  throttling back on  loan growth or raising more capital if the Fed keeps going and deposits  flee more quickly than anticipated.

Silvergate may have been an unusual bank. But its story carries old lessons that all investors sometimes need to relearn.",40,7,"Silvergate Story Is About Fundamentals, Not Just Crypto (Via [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/silvergates-story-is-about-fundamentals-not-just-crypto-30f08fc6) \-- [non-paywall link here](https://archive.is/mfmai))

Unlike some bank failures of recent memory, Silvergate didn’t  have bad assets in the sense of risky loans or complex derivatives. In  fact, its assets were mostly unassailable things like U.S. Treasurys and  agency mortgage-backed securities. But credit risk—or the risk of not  being paid back—isn’t the only kind of risk banks face. Securities such  as these carry interest-rate risk.

So **when rates surged as the Federal Reserve hiked in 2022,  Treasurys and mortgage bonds plunged in price**. Now if a bank is able to hold on to these securities until they mature,  it doesn’t ultimately lose anything. **The problem comes if a bank needs  to sell them before maturity, crystallizing the losses in their market  value. Silvergate has said it had to sell securities amid its deposit outflows**.

Banks can plan for this risk by aiming to match the duration of  their liabilities, which includes deposits, to their assets. For  example, if a bank is getting funding via a one-year certificate of  deposit, it can buy a Treasury maturing in one year to match. But if a  bank’s deposits can move at any moment, it has to weigh that risk when  investing.

A bank could just keep all its money in cash. But to earn more,  banks need to take more risk. They can manage this by building up a mix  of deposits that don’t all move or reprice at once. This is done by  diversifying across customer and account types, or by adding term  deposits such as CDs. Banks also diversify with assets that are floating  rate, like many kinds of corporate loans or credit card loans.

So most banks aren’t subject to risks of a single industry such  as crypto. Having so much of its funding coming from similar types of  depositors turned out to be one of Silvergate’s biggest risks. But there  are still echoes across banking. For one, the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corp. reports that banks had unrealized losses on securities of about $620 billion as of the fourth quarter. Plus, banks’ deposits are starting to move more quickly,  and against the backdrop of the Fed’s aggressive rate increases and the  unusual postpandemic economy, it isn’t clear exactly what their  ultimate velocity will be. Notably, valuable deposits on which banks don’t pay any interest have been declining.

Banks generally have a number of sources of liquidity and have  diversified over time. Few are at risk of needing to wind down so  quickly. But many may still have to take actions  throttling back on  loan growth or raising more capital if the Fed keeps going and deposits  flee more quickly than anticipated.

Silvergate may have been an unusual bank. But its story carries old lessons that all investors sometimes need to relearn."

#[Dow futures fall following Thursday’s market selloff fueled by banks, U.S. jobs report looms](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/09/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Friday as investors look to upcoming job data for clues into how the Federal Reserve may move forward. The action follows a steep sell-off led by bank shares.
*****
&gt; Dow futures shed 66 points, or 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 futures dipped 0.1%, and Nasdaq-100 futures traded flat.
*****
&gt; Shares of the SVB Financial tumbled again on Friday, down another 63% after initially plunging on plans to raise more than $2 billion in capital in a bid to offset losses from bond sales.
*****
&gt; The move weighed on the financial sector and banking stocks, with the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF down more than 2%. Shares of First Republic and Signature Bank were last down about 18% and 12%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Wall Street posted a losing session Thursday. A drop in SVB Financial shares spurred a broad financial sector selloff, as investors grew concerned that higher interest rates would result in banks facing losses on loans due to borrower defaults. The selloff pushed the S&amp;P’s financial sector down 4.1% for its worst day since 2020.
*****
&gt; On Thursday, the Nasdaq Composite recorded a 2.05% slide, while the S&amp;P 500 posted a 1.85% dip. The Dow lost 543.54 points, or 1.66%, as the 30-stock index closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time since Nov. 9. All three major averages are on pace to finish the week down 3% or more.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is bracing for February jobs report, which is slated to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect nonfarm payrolls to rise 225,000 in the month, which would mark a slowdown in growth from January’s unexpectedly large gain of 517,000.
*****
&gt; The unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged from January — when it hit a low not seen since 1969 — at 3.4%, according to Dow Jones. Hourly wages are expected to have increased 0.4% from the prior month, gaining 4.8% from 12 months ago, economists estimate.
*****
&gt; While having more jobs is considered good for the economy, a better-than-expected report can push stocks lower, according to Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. That’s because more workers can signal more demand, he said, which would indicate higher inflation.
*****
&gt; Traders are pricing in a roughly 63% chance of the Federal Reserve raising rates by half of a percentage point at its next policy meeting in about two weeks, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Investors see Friday’s job report as a key driver in that decision, given the central bank’s continued focus on the strength of the labor market as a justification for rate increases.
*****
&gt; “A strong report would be bad news for the Fed, for interest rates, and for markets,” McMillan said.

&gt; Dow futures shed 66 points, or 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 futures dipped 0.1%, and Nasdaq-100 futures traded flat.
*****
&gt; Shares of the SVB Financial tumbled again on Friday, down another 63% after initially plunging on plans to raise more than $2 billion in capital in a bid to offset losses from bond sales.
*****
&gt; The move weighed on the financial sector and banking stocks, with the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF down more than 2%. Shares of First Republic and Signature Bank were last down about 18% and 12%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Wall Street posted a losing session Thursday. A drop in SVB Financial shares spurred a broad financial sector selloff, as investors grew concerned that higher interest rates would result in banks facing losses on loans due to borrower defaults. The selloff pushed the S&amp;P’s financial sector down 4.1% for its worst day since 2020.
*****
&gt; On Thursday, the Nasdaq Composite recorded a 2.05% slide, while the S&amp;P 500 posted a 1.85% dip. The Dow lost 543.54 points, or 1.66%, as the 30-stock index closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time since Nov. 9. All three major averages are on pace to finish the week down 3% or more.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is bracing for February jobs report, which is slated to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect nonfarm payrolls to rise 225,000 in the month, which would mark a slowdown in growth from January’s unexpectedly large gain of 517,000.
*****
&gt; The unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged from January — when it hit a low not seen since 1969 — at 3.4%, according to Dow Jones. Hourly wages are expected to have increased 0.4% from the prior month, gaining 4.8% from 12 months ago, economists estimate.
*****
&gt; While having more jobs is considered good for the economy, a better-than-expected report can push stocks lower, according to Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. That’s because more workers can signal more demand, he said, which would indicate higher inflation.
*****
&gt; Traders are pricing in a roughly 63% chance of the Federal Reserve raising rates by half of a percentage point at its next policy meeting in about two weeks, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Investors see Friday’s job report as a key driver in that decision, given the central bank’s continued focus on the strength of the labor market as a justification for rate increases.
*****
&gt; “A strong report would be bad news for the Fed, for interest rates, and for markets,” McMillan said.

SVB Financial, parent of Silicon Valley Bank, is in talks to sell itself, sources told CNBC’s David Faber.

Attempts by the bank to raise capital have failed, the sources said, and the bank has hired advisors to explore a potential sale.

Large financial institutions are taking a look at a potential purchase of SVB. However, deposits outflows are so far outpacing the sale process, making it very difficult for a realistic assessment of the bank by potential buyers to take place, the sources told Faber.

Shares of the bank fell 60% on Thursday after SVB announced a plan Wednesday evening to raise more than $2 billion in capital. The stock fell another 60% in premarket trading Friday before being halted for pending news. The shares did not open for trading with the rest of the market at 9:30 a.m. and were still halted.

Under the terms of a plan released Wednesday, SVB was looking to sell $1.25 billion in common stock and another $500 million of convertible preferred shares.

SVB also announced a deal with investment firm General Atlantic to sell $500 million of common stock, though that agreement was contingent on the closing of the other common stock offering, according to a securities filing.

SVB is a major bank for venture-backed companies, and cited cash burn from clients as one reason it was looking to raise additional capital.

However, rising interest rates, fears of a recession and a slowdown in the market for initial public offerings has made it harder for early stage companies to raise more cash. This has apparently led the firms to draw down on their deposits at banks like SVB.

Wall Street analysts said on Thursday and Friday that the troubles at SVB seemed unlikely to spread widely throughout the banking system. Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients that SVB’s issues were “highly idiosyncratic.”

Also on Wednesday, SVB announced that it sold $21 billion worth of securities to raise cash and reposition its balance sheet toward assets with shorter duration, which are less exposed to rising interest rates. SVB estimated that it took a $1.8 billion loss on that sale.

Say that halt extends through expiration, does that expiration date then get extended? Or are you SOL"

Troubled lender Silicon Valley Bank has been closed by the FDIC after deposit outflows and a failed capital raise sent the firm into crisis this week.

In a statement released late Friday morning, the FDIC said: ""Silicon Valley Bank, Santa Clara, California, was closed today by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as receiver. To protect insured depositors, the FDIC created the Deposit Insurance National Bank of Santa Clara (DINB). At the time of closing, the FDIC as receiver immediately transferred to the DINB all insured deposits of Silicon Valley Bank.""

Shares of the bank's parent company, SVB Financial (SIVB), remained halted for trade on Friday after having lost 60% on Thursday and another 60% in pre-market trading on Friday.

The FDIC's statement continued: ""All insured depositors will have full access to their insured deposits no later than Monday morning, March 13, 2023. The FDIC will pay uninsured depositors an advance dividend within the next week. Uninsured depositors will receive a receivership certificate for the remaining amount of their uninsured funds.

As you’ve heard the bank has gone into bankruptcy protection essentially.

Reason being was that the bank invested depositors money into long term bonds. Those bonds value dropped as interest rates have been rising causing them to lack enough asset backing to match the amount of depositor money in the bank.

People ask for their money and they don’t have enough.

Bank run. 

Curious, the way this bank went under doesn’t seem to be because of greed or anything like that. They invested in conservative assets like bonds and went under.

What’s the difference then between how this bank works and how the top five like TD do?

Thanks.",11,14,"What’s the difference between how Silicon Valley Bank functions and others? Hi guys,

As for me,  likely by Monday morning I'll be looking to short on an equal weight basis (since smaller companies are more likely to be impacted) - though I'm going to review financials this weekend. If a company has no cash on hand, they have less to lose, for example.   Currently I don't have any positions, I spent too long writing this up and the market closed.

&amp;#x200B;

Note:  SOFI released an 8k ""SOFI informs its investors that it does not hold assets with SVB."" The Company has an approximately 40 million dollar lending facility through SVB, which is unaffected by the FDIC receivership of SVB""  

I've been reviewing the other 8-k filings [(there's over 200 today with Silicon Valley Bank in their text)](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/#/q=Silicon%2520valley%2520bank&amp;dateRange=custom&amp;category=form-cat1&amp;startdt=2023-03-09&amp;enddt=2023-03-10) to see if there's any others to exclude from the above list."

11o2hd6,2023-03-10 22:11:05,investing,Prestigious_Risk7610,how to assess the impacts of SVB collapse,"I'm not going to go into background and context, just so I can manage the post length.

My simple question is what will be the impact of the collapse?  I'll set out my thoughts, but really I want to prompt a conversation that people add to - i.e. I'd prefer to hear people's view (ideally with data) rather than just hear that I'm right or wrong.

Impact on banks
- SVB is pretty unique so there should be no/limited copycat fails
- however, lots of banks have 'hold to maturity' bonds.  These are not priced MTM, so haven't been reflected in P&amp;Ls.  That's not a problem, as long as they don't need to sell.
- the reason they'd need to sell would be to fund outflows (i.e. deposit withdrawals or new lending)

My conclusion is there is limited impact.  I don't see further withdrawal runs.  At the margin I could see some banks being cautious about new lending, but I can't see it being a major issue.


Impact on SVB customers
- most of the customers are VC backed startups or those that have exited onto the public markets.  There aren't many retail customers, and those few retail customers are mostly founders.
- this means 93% of deposits aren't FDIC insured
- clearly not all of this money is lost, as the HTM assets will be sold down in time, but the question is what haircut is taken, and when it gets paid out?
- the issue I see is that lots of VC backed businesses are cashflow negative and have been trying to draw out their reserves to reach a better funding environment once The Fed pivots.  So many are running low on cash anyway, and now they've lost access to a chunk of funds from (often) their primary banking relationship.  Even worse, their owners (VC/PE funds) have limited ability to chip in funds because a chunk of their funds are frozen as they banked with SVB.

My conclusion is that we could see many tech companies be stressed.  It will bring forward either the execution of fundraises, but only the strongest will be able to compete for relatively limited capital.  The middling strength will substantially cut back on cash burn (i.e. layoffs).  The weakest will fail, although not necessarily immediately.  I see this having a meaningful and pretty swift impact on the economy


Impact on consumers
- limited immediate impacts from SVB collapse due to few retail accounts
- however, I'd expect those tech layoffs will hit households
- but tech (particularly the start up end) is not a large employer (although it is in certain locations)
-start ups are not systemically important so limited impact on consumers day to day life
- VC funds will take significant write downs, and so will the investors.  But as these investors skew heavily to the top of the wealth scale it probably won't impact spending in the economy

My conclusion is that, at the margin we'll see unemployment tick up and a drag on consumer spending, but unlikely to see much happen


Overall, I see this being very bad for early stage tech (and its employees), but limited impact on other banks or the economy as a whole.

# **Dow closes more than 300 points lower, posts worst week since June as Silicon Valley Bank collapse sparks selloff: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/09/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks tumbled Friday as tech-focused lender Silicon Valley Bank shut down following losses in its bond portfolio, prompting the biggest bank failure since the global financial crisis and sending shockwaves through the banking sector.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped for a fourth consecutive day, finishing 345.22 points lower, or 1.07%, to close at 31,909.64. The S&amp;P 500 lost 1.45% to settle at 3,861.59. The Nasdaq Composite shed 1.76% to end at 11,138.89.
*****
&gt; All the major averages capped off the week with losses. The Dow fell 4.44% to post its worst weekly performance since June. The S&amp;P dropped 4.55%, while the Nasdaq lost 4.71%.
*****
&gt; Regulators took control of Silicon Valley Bank on Friday, after shares tumbled Thursday and the bank struggled on Friday to find another company to buy it. Regional bank stocks tumbled in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank’s demise, with the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF lost nearly 4.4%. For the week, the regional bank fund lost about 16%, its worst week since March 2020 as the pandemic hit.
*****
&gt; “You had a major U.S. bank collapse, the biggest bank failure since 2008, inevitably that’s going to spook the market,” said Sylvia Jablonski, CEO and chief investment officer of Defiance ETFs. The failure, she added, is also fueling concern among investors over whether the contagion spreads beyond SVB.
*****
&gt; Several bank stocks were repeatedly halted on Friday, including First Republic, PacWest and c/rypto-focused Signature Bank. First Republic dropped 14.8%, and PacWest shed 37.9%. Some bellwether bank stocks suffered smaller losses even as SVB’s fallout wreaked havoc on regional names. Goldman Sachs and Bank of America fell 4.2% and 0.9% respectively. JPMorgan held onto a 2.5% gain.
*****
&gt; “This is gamebook play, where traders and shorter term investors don’t want to be long over the weekend,” said Rich Steinberg, chief market strategist at The Colony Group.
*****
&gt; The turmoil among bank stocks overshadowed a February jobs report, which gave some hints that inflation could be slowing. Payrolls increased more than expected, but investors focused on the smaller-than-expected gain in wages, which may cause the Federal Reserve to rethink its aggressive stance on rate hikes.

&gt; # Payrolls Strong but Unemployment Rises: All Mixed Up

&gt; Another month, another solid employment report. Employment rose by 311,000 in February, on the back of 504,000 in January and 239,000 in December. It’s certainly been a warm winter. This is the labor market that refuses to give in, despite the Fed throwing almost 500 bps (5%-points) of rate hikes at it and gearing up for more.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-10-payrolls-1202x1600.png))**

&gt; # But the unemployment rate rose …
&gt; Yes, the unemployment rate rose to 3.6%, up from 3.4% in January. However, that was entirely for positive reasons.

&gt; The unemployment rate, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) measures it, is the number of people unemployed who are looking for work divided by the size of the labor force. Last month, the number of unemployed people that are looking for work rose by about 240,000. However, that’s because 419,000 people “entered” the labor force, i.e., started looking for work. That’s a sign of a healthy labor market. People will start looking for work only if they think they can get a job.

&gt; The labor force measure has issues related to how participation is measured – they count someone as being in the labor force only if someone is looking for work. But a lot of people may not do so for any number of reasons, including not feeling confident in the job market or non-economic reasons like not having access to childcare. The measure also can fall over time because of a lot of retiring baby-boomers.

&gt; One way to get around these issues is to look at the employment-population ratio for prime age workers, i.e., workers aged 25-54 years. This measures the number of people working as a percent of the civilian population – think of it as the opposite of the unemployment rate, and because we use prime age, you get around the demographic issue as well.

&gt; The good news is that the prime-age employment-population ratio just hit 80.5%, which is close to the highest level we’ve seen in a couple of decades.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-10-e-pop-ratio-1203x1600.png))**

&gt; It helps to recall that we just had a multi-generational black swan event in the form of a pandemic. But once everything re-opened, the expectation was that things would bounce back immediately. And a lot of numbers did, including GDP, employment, and consumption.

&gt; However, there were also a lot of people who left the labor force amid the pandemic. And what we’re seeing now is that each month there’s a continuous flow of people back into the labor force, and these people are finding jobs quickly. Just over the past six months, 1.5 million more people have come into the labor force as prospects for finding a job improve.

&gt; Make no mistake, this is a really strong labor market in my opinion.

&gt; # Is the labor market too strong?
&gt; It’s weird to even ask that question, but it matters for the Federal Reserve. In their model for the economy, they see a tight labor market as one that results in stronger wage growth. And strong wage growth can drive demand higher, pushing up prices and inflation.

&gt; Well, hopefully, they can rest a little easy on that front. Average hourly earnings rose just 0.2% in February. Over the past three months, wages have been growing at an annualized pace of 3.6%, well below the 6%+ pace we saw last year. It’s getting very close to the pre-pandemic pace of 3.1%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-10-ahe-3m-change-1212x1600.png))**

&gt; This backs up other evidence that wage growth is indeed easing, including the Employment Cost Index, which is the gold standard of wage growth measures. The ECI was running at an annualized pace of 4.2% in Q4 2022, down from 4.8% in Q3. The January-February hourly earnings data suggest that wage growth continues to decelerate.

&gt; The big question is whether the Fed buys this. Powell’s comments this week in front of Congress did not inspire confidence. It looks like a string of hot economic data has left them questioning their decision to ease the pace of rate increases from 50 bps to 25 bps (as of February) – and wondering if they should move that back up to 50 bps at their March meeting. At this point, markets think the outcome is a coin toss, which is not great as Powell simply injected maximum uncertainty into markets.

&gt; But looking beyond the Fed’s March meeting, the big picture is that the labor market appears to remain really strong. This means the economy also remains strong, and that’s not a bad thing as far as markets are concerned. Though it also means the Fed is likely to keep interest rates higher for longer.

*****

&gt; # Panic! At the Fed?

&gt; Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s comments this week during his semi-annual testimony in front of Congress did not inspire much confidence with respect to the path for monetary policy. It seems like Fed officials’ are confused as to what they want to do next.

&gt; Case in point: last month, Powell said that the “disinflationary process has started.”

&gt; Since then, we’ve had a run of strong economic data, including January payrolls, retail sales, and inflation. And it looks like that was enough to spook the Fed. The shift was clear in Powell’s statements this week:

&gt; “Inflationary pressures are running higher than expected at the time of our previous Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.”

&gt; And

&gt; “The ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated.”

&gt; At the same time, he also said:

&gt; “If – and I stress that no decision has been made on this — if the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes.”

&gt; Markets were clearly taken aback by his comments, with equities falling 1.5% on Tuesday (March 7th) and rate hike expectations rising.

&gt; This becomes clear if you look at expectations for their March meeting. Last Friday, markets were expecting a 0.25% increase in the federal funds rate, pricing the probability of that at 72%.

&gt; That’s shifted significantly since Powell’s comments this week. Investors moved the probability of a 0.25% increase down to 28%, and the probability of a 0.50% increase rose to almost 80%.

&gt; This is a huge shift, especially this close to a meeting. Typically, the couple of weeks prior to the meeting is a “quiet period,” where Fed officials don’t give speeches or comments, i.e., anything that may lead to a shift in expectations. The last time this happened was in June 2022, when the Wall Street Journal reported that the Fed was considering raising rates by 0.75% instead of the 0.50% they guided markets toward.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-09-March-rate-hike-expectations-1202x1600.png))**

&gt; # There’s not much reason to panic
&gt; To be clear, the January data was hotter than expected. But this is just one month of data and is likely a rebound from the relatively soft December data (which, at the time, led to increased recession calls) and perhaps positive weather-related effects.

&gt; We’re yet to get February data, but it’s hard to believe the string of hot data continues into February and March.

&gt; Take vehicle sales, for example. Sales surged 19% in January to a 15.9 million annualized pace, the highest since May 2021. But sales pulled back to 14.9 million in February. So the trend is still positive, but nothing suggests that the economy is overheating to the extent that the Fed has to up-end market expectations for upcoming policy.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-09-auto-sales.png))**

&gt; The Carson Investment Research team has been in the camp that the economy will avoid a recession this year. As we’ve discussed before, we believe consumers are in good shape, and real incomes are rising, which should keep consumption humming along.

&gt; This gets to the point that we don’t see the Fed cutting rates any time soon. Expectations for the terminal rate, i.e., the highest rate the Fed will get to, also rose this week. At the beginning of the year, investors expected the terminal rate to end up around 4.9%. That’s now increased to about 5.6% on the back of strong economic data.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-09-rate-expectations-1202x1600.png))**

&gt; The good news is that, at the end of the day, positive economic data is positive. This perhaps explains why equities have remained resilient this year. The S&amp;P 500 is up just under 4% year-to-date, despite rate expectations repricing higher.

&gt; That’s a big shift from last year and a positive one. And we believe equities have the potential to remain resilient, even as the economic data (and the Fed) swing back and forth.

&gt; # This Doesn't Happen Often

&gt; After a surge earlier this week that took the yield on the two-year US Treasury up above 5% for the first time since 2007, concerns over the health of bank balance sheets have caused a sharp reversal lower. From a closing high of 5.07% on Wednesday, the yield on the two-year US Treasury has plummeted to 4.62% and is on pace for its largest two-day decline since September 2008. Remember that?

&gt; A 45 basis point (bps) two-day decline in the two-year yield has been extremely uncommon over the last 46 years. Of the 79 prior occurrences, two-thirds occurred during recessions, and the only times that a move of this magnitude did not occur either within six months before or after a recession were during the crash of 1987 (10/19 and 10/20) as well as 10/13/89 when the leveraged buyout of United Airlines fell through, resulting in a collapse of the junk bond market. As you can see from the New York Times headline the day after that 1989 plunge, just as investors are worrying today over whether we're in for a repeat of the Financial Crisis, back then they were looking at 'troubling similarities' to the 1987 crash. The year that followed the October 1989 decline wasn't a particularly positive period for equities, but a repeat of anything close to the 1987 crash never materialized.

&gt; # 50-DMAs Couldn't Hold

&gt; Worries about banks today left major US index ETFs across the market cap spectrum back below their 50-day moving averages. The uptrend channels that have been formed over the last six months are also getting tested with this week's move lower. You can see the current set-ups in the snapshot from our Chart Scanner tool below.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/50days.png))**

&gt; Looking at our Trend Analyzer, every sector ETF except for Technology has now moved back below its 50-day moving average. Six of eleven sectors are actually oversold (&gt;1 standard deviation below 50-DMA), with Financials (XLF) and Health Care (XLV) at ""extreme oversold"" levels. XLF had been up more than 8% on the year about a month ago, but it's now down 1.93% YTD.

&gt; Technology (XLK) and Utilities (XLU) are the only two sectors up over the last week. Interestingly, Utilities (XLU) has been one of the worst performing sectors so far this year, while Tech has been the best.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/ussectoretfs.png))**

&gt; With Financials seeing such a sharp decline this week, below is a snapshot of various banks and brokers in the sector with the ones highlighted in red all now trading at least 5% below their 50-DMA. As shown, Charles Schwab (SCHW) is down the most over the last week with a decline of 12.6%, which has left it 16.4% below its 50-DMA and down nearly 20% on the year. Other names like Bank of America (BAC), JP Morgan (JPM), and Raymond James (RJF) are in extreme oversold territory as well. Of the major banks and brokers listed, Goldman Sachs (GS) has actually held up the best over the last week with a decline of just 2%.

&gt; # Bearish Sentiment Remains

&gt; The S&amp;P 500's swings higher and then lower over the past week have left sentiment little changed. For the American Association of Individual Investors' (AAII) weekly survey, 24.8% of respondents reporting as bullish compared to 23.4% the previous week. That is the second higher reading in a row but still well below the recent high of 37.5% from one month ago.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030923-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; Along with a modest bounce in bullishness, bearish sentiment has taken a modest decline falling from a recent high of 44.8% last week down to 41.7% today. That is the first decline in a month, leaving it in the middle of its range since the start of last year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030923-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; Given the moves in bullish and bearish sentiment, the bull-bear spread remains skewed in favor of bears for the third week in a row.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030923-AAII-3.png))**

&gt; Following a sharp eight percentage point decline last week, neutral sentiment has bounced rising to 33.4%. Albeit higher, outside of last week, that reading would be the lowest since the end of 2022.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030923-AAII-4.png))**

&gt; Although recent weeks have seen the AAII survey return to deeply bearish sentiment, other surveys are not nearly as pessimistic. While the AAII survey's bull-bear spread sits well over a standard deviation below its historical average, the NAAIM Exposure index continues to show only modestly long positioning among active managers. Currently, that reading is 0.2 standard deviations below the historical norm. Meanwhile, the weekly Investors Intelligence survey is actually showing respondents are reporting as more bullish than has been historically normal.

&gt; # A Closer Look at Seasonality

&gt; We talked a lot about how February (especially the second half of February) could be a potential break for stocks, well the good news is that we now see many signs of better times potentially coming soon.

&gt; Here’s what the average year for the S&amp;P 500 looks like. Looking at the chart below, the blue line shows gains from January through April, and November and December are normal. It is the middle part of the year that stocks tend to struggle.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-164.png))**

&gt; Lately, things look a little different. Looking at only the past 20 years showed that stocks tended to bottom in March. This is likely due to major bear market lows taking place during this month in 2003, 2009, and 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-273.jpg))**

&gt; We’ve shared before that pre-election years tend to be strong for stocks, lower only twice going back to World War II and up nearly 17% on average, making this historically the strongest year of the 4-year Presidential cycle. Looking at these years it is once again common to see the second half of February weakness and a tradeable low in late February.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-321.jpg))**

&gt; Building on this, we found that pre-election years of a new President do even better, up close to 20% on average. But wouldn’t you know it, right about now tended to be a consolidation period before late March and April strength.

&gt; What about years that started off with big gains? When stocks gained more than 5% in January (like 2023) we found that a consolidation period took place now and into April. The good news is that eventual gains of close to 23% on average were how things ended up, suggesting any potential consolidation here could potentially be used as an opportunity.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-599.png))**

&gt; Lastly, I’ve seen other places combine many of the things I’ve just discussed and make one composite combining them all. I did that and we called it the Carson Cycle Composite. This proprietary composite looks at the average year, pre-election years, pre-election years under a new President, the past 20 years, and years that had a 5% January. As you can see, this year started off stronger, but as of early March is right in line with what the average composite looks like. Take note, a gain of 15.6% is what has been the average Carson Cycle Composite.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-640.png))**

&gt; The bottom line is many cycles suggest the potential for some type of a consolidation here and now would be perfectly normal, but the likelihood of strength before the end of the year is quite strong.

# **Dow closes more than 300 points lower, posts worst week since June as Silicon Valley Bank collapse sparks selloff: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/09/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks tumbled Friday as tech-focused lender Silicon Valley Bank shut down following losses in its bond portfolio, prompting the biggest bank failure since the global financial crisis and sending shockwaves through the banking sector.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped for a fourth consecutive day, finishing 345.22 points lower, or 1.07%, to close at 31,909.64. The S&amp;P 500 lost 1.45% to settle at 3,861.59. The Nasdaq Composite shed 1.76% to end at 11,138.89.
*****
&gt; All the major averages capped off the week with losses. The Dow fell 4.44% to post its worst weekly performance since June. The S&amp;P dropped 4.55%, while the Nasdaq lost 4.71%.
*****
&gt; Regulators took control of Silicon Valley Bank on Friday, after shares tumbled Thursday and the bank struggled on Friday to find another company to buy it. Regional bank stocks tumbled in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank’s demise, with the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF lost nearly 4.4%. For the week, the regional bank fund lost about 16%, its worst week since March 2020 as the pandemic hit.
*****
&gt; “You had a major U.S. bank collapse, the biggest bank failure since 2008, inevitably that’s going to spook the market,” said Sylvia Jablonski, CEO and chief investment officer of Defiance ETFs. The failure, she added, is also fueling concern among investors over whether the contagion spreads beyond SVB.
*****
&gt; Several bank stocks were repeatedly halted on Friday, including First Republic, PacWest and c/rypto-focused Signature Bank. First Republic dropped 14.8%, and PacWest shed 37.9%. Some bellwether bank stocks suffered smaller losses even as SVB’s fallout wreaked havoc on regional names. Goldman Sachs and Bank of America fell 4.2% and 0.9% respectively. JPMorgan held onto a 2.5% gain.
*****
&gt; “This is gamebook play, where traders and shorter term investors don’t want to be long over the weekend,” said Rich Steinberg, chief market strategist at The Colony Group.
*****
&gt; The turmoil among bank stocks overshadowed a February jobs report, which gave some hints that inflation could be slowing. Payrolls increased more than expected, but investors focused on the smaller-than-expected gain in wages, which may cause the Federal Reserve to rethink its aggressive stance on rate hikes.

&gt; # Payrolls Strong but Unemployment Rises: All Mixed Up

&gt; # But the unemployment rate rose …
&gt; Yes, the unemployment rate rose to 3.6%, up from 3.4% in January. However, that was entirely for positive reasons.

&gt; The unemployment rate, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) measures it, is the number of people unemployed who are looking for work divided by the size of the labor force. Last month, the number of unemployed people that are looking for work rose by about 240,000. However, that’s because 419,000 people “entered” the labor force, i.e., started looking for work. That’s a sign of a healthy labor market. People will start looking for work only if they think they can get a job.

&gt; The good news is that the prime-age employment-population ratio just hit 80.5%, which is close to the highest level we’ve seen in a couple of decades.

&gt; # Is the labor market too strong?
&gt; It’s weird to even ask that question, but it matters for the Federal Reserve. In their model for the economy, they see a tight labor market as one that results in stronger wage growth. And strong wage growth can drive demand higher, pushing up prices and inflation.

&gt; Well, hopefully, they can rest a little easy on that front. Average hourly earnings rose just 0.2% in February. Over the past three months, wages have been growing at an annualized pace of 3.6%, well below the 6%+ pace we saw last year. It’s getting very close to the pre-pandemic pace of 3.1%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-10-ahe-3m-change-1212x1600.png))**

&gt; This backs up other evidence that wage growth is indeed easing, including the Employment Cost Index, which is the gold standard of wage growth measures. The ECI was running at an annualized pace of 4.2% in Q4 2022, down from 4.8% in Q3. The January-February hourly earnings data suggest that wage growth continues to decelerate.

&gt; The big question is whether the Fed buys this. Powell’s comments this week in front of Congress did not inspire confidence. It looks like a string of hot economic data has left them questioning their decision to ease the pace of rate increases from 50 bps to 25 bps (as of February) – and wondering if they should move that back up to 50 bps at their March meeting. At this point, markets think the outcome is a coin toss, which is not great as Powell simply injected maximum uncertainty into markets.

&gt; But looking beyond the Fed’s March meeting, the big picture is that the labor market appears to remain really strong. This means the economy also remains strong, and that’s not a bad thing as far as markets are concerned. Though it also means the Fed is likely to keep interest rates higher for longer.

&gt; # Panic! At the Fed?

&gt; Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s comments this week during his semi-annual testimony in front of Congress did not inspire much confidence with respect to the path for monetary policy. It seems like Fed officials’ are confused as to what they want to do next.

&gt; Case in point: last month, Powell said that the “disinflationary process has started.”

&gt; Since then, we’ve had a run of strong economic data, including January payrolls, retail sales, and inflation. And it looks like that was enough to spook the Fed. The shift was clear in Powell’s statements this week:

&gt; “Inflationary pressures are running higher than expected at the time of our previous Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.”

&gt; And

&gt; “The ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated.”

&gt; At the same time, he also said:

&gt; “If – and I stress that no decision has been made on this — if the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes.”

&gt; Markets were clearly taken aback by his comments, with equities falling 1.5% on Tuesday (March 7th) and rate hike expectations rising.

&gt; This becomes clear if you look at expectations for their March meeting. Last Friday, markets were expecting a 0.25% increase in the federal funds rate, pricing the probability of that at 72%.

&gt; That’s shifted significantly since Powell’s comments this week. Investors moved the probability of a 0.25% increase down to 28%, and the probability of a 0.50% increase rose to almost 80%.

&gt; This is a huge shift, especially this close to a meeting. Typically, the couple of weeks prior to the meeting is a “quiet period,” where Fed officials don’t give speeches or comments, i.e., anything that may lead to a shift in expectations. The last time this happened was in June 2022, when the Wall Street Journal reported that the Fed was considering raising rates by 0.75% instead of the 0.50% they guided markets toward.

&gt; # There’s not much reason to panic
&gt; To be clear, the January data was hotter than expected. But this is just one month of data and is likely a rebound from the relatively soft December data (which, at the time, led to increased recession calls) and perhaps positive weather-related effects.

&gt; We’re yet to get February data, but it’s hard to believe the string of hot data continues into February and March.

&gt; Take vehicle sales, for example. Sales surged 19% in January to a 15.9 million annualized pace, the highest since May 2021. But sales pulled back to 14.9 million in February. So the trend is still positive, but nothing suggests that the economy is overheating to the extent that the Fed has to up-end market expectations for upcoming policy.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-09-auto-sales.png))**

&gt; The Carson Investment Research team has been in the camp that the economy will avoid a recession this year. As we’ve discussed before, we believe consumers are in good shape, and real incomes are rising, which should keep consumption humming along.

&gt; This gets to the point that we don’t see the Fed cutting rates any time soon. Expectations for the terminal rate, i.e., the highest rate the Fed will get to, also rose this week. At the beginning of the year, investors expected the terminal rate to end up around 4.9%. That’s now increased to about 5.6% on the back of strong economic data.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-09-rate-expectations-1202x1600.png))**

&gt; The good news is that, at the end of the day, positive economic data is positive. This perhaps explains why equities have remained resilient this year. The S&amp;P 500 is up just under 4% year-to-date, despite rate expectations repricing higher.

&gt; That’s a big shift from last year and a positive one. And we believe equities have the potential to remain resilient, even as the economic data (and the Fed) swing back and forth.

&gt; # This Doesn't Happen Often

&gt; After a surge earlier this week that took the yield on the two-year US Treasury up above 5% for the first time since 2007, concerns over the health of bank balance sheets have caused a sharp reversal lower. From a closing high of 5.07% on Wednesday, the yield on the two-year US Treasury has plummeted to 4.62% and is on pace for its largest two-day decline since September 2008. Remember that?

&gt; A 45 basis point (bps) two-day decline in the two-year yield has been extremely uncommon over the last 46 years. Of the 79 prior occurrences, two-thirds occurred during recessions, and the only times that a move of this magnitude did not occur either within six months before or after a recession were during the crash of 1987 (10/19 and 10/20) as well as 10/13/89 when the leveraged buyout of United Airlines fell through, resulting in a collapse of the junk bond market. As you can see from the New York Times headline the day after that 1989 plunge, just as investors are worrying today over whether we're in for a repeat of the Financial Crisis, back then they were looking at 'troubling similarities' to the 1987 crash. The year that followed the October 1989 decline wasn't a particularly positive period for equities, but a repeat of anything close to the 1987 crash never materialized.

&gt; # 50-DMAs Couldn't Hold

&gt; Worries about banks today left major US index ETFs across the market cap spectrum back below their 50-day moving averages. The uptrend channels that have been formed over the last six months are also getting tested with this week's move lower. You can see the current set-ups in the snapshot from our Chart Scanner tool below.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/50days.png))**

&gt; Looking at our Trend Analyzer, every sector ETF except for Technology has now moved back below its 50-day moving average. Six of eleven sectors are actually oversold (&gt;1 standard deviation below 50-DMA), with Financials (XLF) and Health Care (XLV) at ""extreme oversold"" levels. XLF had been up more than 8% on the year about a month ago, but it's now down 1.93% YTD.

&gt; Technology (XLK) and Utilities (XLU) are the only two sectors up over the last week. Interestingly, Utilities (XLU) has been one of the worst performing sectors so far this year, while Tech has been the best.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/ussectoretfs.png))**

&gt; With Financials seeing such a sharp decline this week, below is a snapshot of various banks and brokers in the sector with the ones highlighted in red all now trading at least 5% below their 50-DMA. As shown, Charles Schwab (SCHW) is down the most over the last week with a decline of 12.6%, which has left it 16.4% below its 50-DMA and down nearly 20% on the year. Other names like Bank of America (BAC), JP Morgan (JPM), and Raymond James (RJF) are in extreme oversold territory as well. Of the major banks and brokers listed, Goldman Sachs (GS) has actually held up the best over the last week with a decline of just 2%.

&gt; # Bearish Sentiment Remains

&gt; The S&amp;P 500's swings higher and then lower over the past week have left sentiment little changed. For the American Association of Individual Investors' (AAII) weekly survey, 24.8% of respondents reporting as bullish compared to 23.4% the previous week. That is the second higher reading in a row but still well below the recent high of 37.5% from one month ago.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030923-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; Along with a modest bounce in bullishness, bearish sentiment has taken a modest decline falling from a recent high of 44.8% last week down to 41.7% today. That is the first decline in a month, leaving it in the middle of its range since the start of last year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030923-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; Given the moves in bullish and bearish sentiment, the bull-bear spread remains skewed in favor of bears for the third week in a row.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030923-AAII-3.png))**

&gt; Following a sharp eight percentage point decline last week, neutral sentiment has bounced rising to 33.4%. Albeit higher, outside of last week, that reading would be the lowest since the end of 2022.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030923-AAII-4.png))**

&gt; Although recent weeks have seen the AAII survey return to deeply bearish sentiment, other surveys are not nearly as pessimistic. While the AAII survey's bull-bear spread sits well over a standard deviation below its historical average, the NAAIM Exposure index continues to show only modestly long positioning among active managers. Currently, that reading is 0.2 standard deviations below the historical norm. Meanwhile, the weekly Investors Intelligence survey is actually showing respondents are reporting as more bullish than has been historically normal.

&gt; # A Closer Look at Seasonality

&gt; We talked a lot about how February (especially the second half of February) could be a potential break for stocks, well the good news is that we now see many signs of better times potentially coming soon.

&gt; Here’s what the average year for the S&amp;P 500 looks like. Looking at the chart below, the blue line shows gains from January through April, and November and December are normal. It is the middle part of the year that stocks tend to struggle.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-164.png))**

&gt; Lately, things look a little different. Looking at only the past 20 years showed that stocks tended to bottom in March. This is likely due to major bear market lows taking place during this month in 2003, 2009, and 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-273.jpg))**

&gt; We’ve shared before that pre-election years tend to be strong for stocks, lower only twice going back to World War II and up nearly 17% on average, making this historically the strongest year of the 4-year Presidential cycle. Looking at these years it is once again common to see the second half of February weakness and a tradeable low in late February.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-321.jpg))**

&gt; Building on this, we found that pre-election years of a new President do even better, up close to 20% on average. But wouldn’t you know it, right about now tended to be a consolidation period before late March and April strength.

&gt; What about years that started off with big gains? When stocks gained more than 5% in January (like 2023) we found that a consolidation period took place now and into April. The good news is that eventual gains of close to 23% on average were how things ended up, suggesting any potential consolidation here could potentially be used as an opportunity.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-599.png))**

&gt; Lastly, I’ve seen other places combine many of the things I’ve just discussed and make one composite combining them all. I did that and we called it the Carson Cycle Composite. This proprietary composite looks at the average year, pre-election years, pre-election years under a new President, the past 20 years, and years that had a 5% January. As you can see, this year started off stronger, but as of early March is right in line with what the average composite looks like. Take note, a gain of 15.6% is what has been the average Carson Cycle Composite.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-640.png))**

&gt; The bottom line is many cycles suggest the potential for some type of a consolidation here and now would be perfectly normal, but the likelihood of strength before the end of the year is quite strong.
