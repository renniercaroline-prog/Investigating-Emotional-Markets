WASHINGTON, March 1 (Reuters) - The United States is sounding out close allies about the possibility of imposing new sanctions on China if Beijing provides military support to Russia for its war in Ukraine, according to four U.S. officials and other sources.

The consultations, which are still at a preliminary stage, are intended to drum up support from a range of countries, especially those in the wealthy Group of 7 (G7), to coordinate support for any possible restrictions.

It was not clear what specific sanctions Washington will propose. The conversations have not been previously disclosed. The U.S. Treasury Department, a lead agency on the imposition of sanctions, declined to comment.

Washington and its allies have said in recent weeks that China was considering providing weapons to Russia, which Beijing denies. Aides to U.S. President Joe Biden have not publicly provided evidence.

They have also warned China directly against doing so, including in meetings between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping as well as during a Feb. 18 in-person meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi on the sidelines of a global security conference in Munich.

The Biden administration's initial steps to counter Chinese support for Russia have included informal outreach at the staff and diplomatic levels, including the Treasury Department, sources familiar with the matter said.

They said officials were laying the groundwork for potential action against Beijing with the core group of countries that were most supportive of sanctions imposed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine a year ago. Asked about the consultations, a White House National Security Council spokesperson said Russia's war made it difficult for China with Europe and others. ""It's a distraction for China and a potential blow to their international relationships they do not need nor should they want,"" the spokesperson said.

INTELLIGENCE
One official from a country consulted by Washington said that they had only seen scant intelligence backing up the claims about China considering possible military assistance to Russia. A U.S. official, however, said they were providing detailed accounts of the intelligence to allies.

China's role in the Russia-Ukraine war is expected to be among the topics when Biden meets with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at the White House on Friday. Before that in New Delhi on Wednesday and Thursday, the war will be discussed by foreign ministers from dozens of countries, including Russia, China and the United States.

Last week China issued a 12-point paper calling for a comprehensive ceasefire that was met with scepticism in the West. The initial outreach by Washington on sanctions has not yet led to broad agreement on any specific measures, the sources said. One source said the administration wanted to first raise the idea of coordinated sanctions and ""take pulses"" in the event that any shipments are detected to Russia from China, which declared a ""no limits"" partnership shortly before the invasion on Feb. 24 last year.

""On the G7 front, I think there is real awareness,"" a second source said, but added that detailed measures focused on China were not yet in place.

COULD CHINA TILT CONFLICT?
The Ukraine conflict has settled into grinding trench warfare. With Russia running low on munitions, Ukraine and its supporters fear that supplies from China could tilt the conflict to Russia's advantage.

As part of a related diplomatic push, Washington won language in a Feb. 24 G7 statement to mark the war's first anniversary that called on ""third-countries"" to ""cease providing material support to Russia's war, or face severe costs.""

Though the statement did not mention China by name, the U.S. imposed new penalties on people and companies accused of helping Russia evade sanctions. The measures included export curbs on companies in China and elsewhere that will block them from buying items, such as semiconductors.

""We've tried to signal very clearly, both in private in Munich, and then publicly, our concerns,"" Daniel Kritenbrink, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, told Congress this week. ""We've talked about the implications and the consequences if they were to do so. And we also know that many of our like-minded partners share those concerns.""

Among the challenges the United States faces in putting sanctions on China, the world's second-biggest economy, is its thorough integration in the major economies of Europe and Asia, complicating the talks. U.S. allies from Germany to South Korea are reticent to alienate China.

Anthony Ruggiero, a sanctions expert under former President Donald Trump, said the Biden administration does have scope for economically restricting private actors within China and that doing so could deter the government and banks from providing further support.

""Then the administration can send messages to China in public and in private, with the latter being more explicit, that the U.S. will escalate the sanctions to include targeting Chinese banks with the full range of available options,"" said Ruggiero, now with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies group.

Washington should make China choose between access to the U.S. financial system or aiding Russia's war, Ruggiero said, citing the sanctions approach to Iran and North Korea.",51,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/11fysi4/market_mispricing_of_geopolitical_risk_us_seeks/,"Market mispricing of geopolitical risk: ""US seeks allies' backing for possible China sanctions over Ukraine war"" (Reuters) Personally I think the market as a general rule is not great at pricing in geopolitical risk.

From Mercury News article by Grace Hase, March 4, 2023

“A gallon of milk, a dozen eggs, a loaf of bread, a pound of chicken: That may be all the groceries some Californians can buy each month with their CalFresh benefits now that emergency federal pandemic funds that boosted food benefits have ended.

The severance comes at a time when Californians are already reeling from inflation and the high cost of groceries, leaving local food bank leaders in fear of a “food cliff” as demand soars and their budgets tighten.

The federal food program, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, received boosts throughout the pandemic as Americans faced furloughs and layoffs and dipped into their savings. But that emergency aid has come to an end, and eligible households will lose at least $95 a month in benefits, with some seeing their benefits dip to as low as $23 a month. Benefits are determined by income and household size.

Nationally, food prices increased by 13.1% between July 2021 and July 2022, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. It estimates that inflation has cut the value of SNAP increases by 76% since 2019.

For one San Jose single mother, the end of the added emergency benefits — which will have its final payout this month — brings worry, stress and a feeling of powerlessness. Her monthly grocery bill had been around $300 — typically what she was receiving in CalFresh benefits with the emergency allotments. Now, her CalFresh benefits are dropping to $38.

Adrianne, 42, who asked to be identified only by her first name, said she recently went back to school, and the emergency allotments during the pandemic have been a lifeline for her and her 7-year-old daughter. She plans to stock up with the final benefits payout but is concerned about whether she’ll be able to rely on a food bank.

“Being a full-time student, taking 15 credits every semester and being a single mom, I really don’t know if I have the time to make it to pick up free food,” she said. “I’m going to have to figure out something.”

Hundreds of thousands of Bay Area families may face similar challenges. In December 2022, roughly 256,000 households were receiving CalFresh benefits in Santa Clara, San Mateo, Alameda and Contra Costa counties, according to the California Department of Social Services. Across California, that number was nearly 3 million.

In Santa Clara and San Mateo counties, the more than 93,000 households receiving CalFresh benefits will lose approximately $16 million per month, according to Second Harvest of Silicon Valley — one of the largest food banks in the country.

As families lose the much-needed emergency benefits, food banks are bracing for an influx in demand. Throughout the pandemic, they broadened their reach as a social safety net as more people sought help — many for the first time. At the beginning of the pandemic, four in 10 people visiting food banks across the country were doing so for the first time, according to the nonprofit Feeding America.

Second Harvest of Silicon Valley — which serves residents in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties — doubled the number of people they fed when the pandemic hit, from about 250,000 clients a month to 500,000.

The nonprofit currently provides food for 460,000 people on average each month — an 80% increase from before the pandemic.
…
Second Harvest CEO Leslie Bacho said many of the federal financial resources that helped them meet the need have disappeared. At the same time, donations fell, and their food costs climbed 30%.”

That’s already led the agency to make some difficult decisions. Second Harvest typically gave out a gallon of milk to clients at food distributions. But at the beginning of the year, they reduced it to a half-gallon.

“The hard reality is we have limited resources, and the numbers are not adding up, so we’re having to take a really hard look at that,” Bacho said.

“For this to happen when inflation is high and food prices are through the roof, it’s really going to be devastating,” she said. “It’s going to be devastating not just for the families and people who need assistance, but also the food banks who are here to provide emergency assistance to people who need services. And it’s also going to be an impact on our local economy.”

After reading that post about ""Freeport never, ever going down again"" I decided to post some of my own research. Like sure, we're all a lil' regarded, but to say that a facility that literally went kaboom will never go down again is just not really DD. So here's what I found and are my thoughts on Natty-G.

First thing before I get into the actual fundamentals is that the AUM for BOIL is off the charts, which is causing issues for the dudes running it. There are position limits on the exchange, so they are having to go to banks to get swaps to keep up with the fund interest. What does that mean? For the longest time, BOIL just tracked NG 2x, but now with such massive interest, BOIL is actually influencing the underlying contracts higher. Every day they have to go out and buy 2x the lots to make sure they aren't left holding the bag when we eventually take our own out. And I mean like hell yeah, bullish $BOIL right? But what happens when the fund has to roll? This ain't what happened in 2021, like yes you can stop out shorts, but we're talking about an actual commodity that isn't just influenced by us, it responds to actual market prices, and those prices say lower. This ain't us vs. some fund, it's us vs. everyone in the US who uses natural gas, which btw is literally everyone.

And they have to sell out and buy the next month because the contracts are for a physical commodity that is bound by month, aka if they don't sell they have to take delivery of a lotttt of actual cow farts in Louisiana. When they sell that many lots in such a short time, it ain't gonna be good. If today's price of NG tanks, the price of summer gas has to tank too because if it didn't, everyone would just buy cheap gas now, put it in storage, and just sell it in the summer. So the summer contracts will drop too. It hasn't been a problem in past months because BOIL wasn't such a large part of the market, but now, dumping that many contracts right before they expire is going to influence the whole futures market past this month (which is the largest part of their position), and that influence ain't gonna be up. Yes, they will use those funds to buy the next month and push it up, but again, we don't have the power here like we did with that retailer; the physical market will eventually tank price this summer in the face of every $BOIL position as we've already started to see today.

Ok on fundamentals, I believe that the BOIL run is basically done, had a nice little uptick Friday. But, many of y'all have been taking profit (see the far right of the chart above where total assets are dropping, so so much for hodling smh although after the rally on Friday y'all bought more, buy high sell low right?), and the final cold weather before next winter is about to hit. This means we're going to turn to injecting the gas into the ground and changing to summer pricing. What does that look like? Well, what do you do when supply is ""10"" and demand is ""8""? You store ""2"" in the ground to use in the winter when supply is still ""10"" and demand is now ""12"". But guess what, that storage space has to be there... We are at the upper range of our natural gas storage coming out of a very warm winter, meaning that before this coming summer ends, we are going to be totally full (we are producing at a record pace and the earnings releases I looked at didn't say they plan on slowing down this year). Again, I ain't the sharpest spoon in the drawer, but I know that when supply is ""10"", demand is ""8"", and you don't have anything to put your ""2"" in, price jumps off a cliff. I can repeat the example with bananas instead of numbers if that's helpful, it helped me anyways.

11l1ui8,2023-03-07 15:10:56,wallstreetbets,predictany007,Fed Chair Powell says interest rates are ‘likely to be higher’ than previously anticipated,"* Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday cautioned that interest rates are likely to head higher than central bank policymakers had expected.
* “If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes,” the central bank leader said in prepared remarks for appearances this week on Capitol Hill.
* Powell said the current trend shows that the Fed’s inflation-fighting job is not over.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday cautioned that interest rates are likely to head higher than central bank policymakers had expected.

Citing earlier data this year showing that inflation has reversed the deceleration it showed in late 2022, the central bank leader warned of tighter monetary policy ahead.

“The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,” Powell said in remarks prepared for two appearances this week on Capitol Hill. “If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes.”

Those remarks carry two implications: One, that the peak, or terminal, level of the federal funds rate is likely to be higher than the previous indication from the Fed officials, and, two, that the switch last month to a smaller quarter percentage point increase could be short-lived of inflation data continue to run hot.

In their December estimate, officials pegged the terminal rate at 5.1%. Current market pricing is a bit higher than that, in the 5.25%-5.5% areas, according to CME Group data. Powell did not specify how high he thinks rates ultimately will go.

The speech comes with markets generally optimistic that the Fed can tame inflation without running the economy into a ditch.

However, January data show that inflation as gauged by personal consumption expenditures prices — the preferred metric for policymakers — was still running at a 5.4% pace annually. That’s well above the Fed’s 2% long-run target and a shade above the December level.

Powell said the current trend shows that the Fed’s inflation-fighting job is not over.

“We have covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our tightening so far are yet to be felt. Even so, we have more work to do,” he said.

The Fed has raised its benchmark fund rate eight times over the past year to its current targeted level between 4.5%-4.75%. On its face, the funds rate sets what banks charge each other for overnight lending. But it feeds through to a multitude of other consumer debt products such as mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.

In recent says, some officials, such as Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, have indicated that they see the rate hikes coming to a close soon. However, others, including Governor Christopher Waller, have expressed concern about the recent inflation data and say tight policy is likely to stay in place.

“Restoring price stability will likely require that we maintain a restrictive stance of monetary policy for some time,” Powell said. “The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done.”

Powell noted some progress on inflation for areas such as housing.

However, he also noted “there is little sign of disinflation” when it comes to the important category of services spending excluding housing, food and energy. That is an important qualifier considering that the chairman at his post-meeting news conference in early February said the disinflationary process had begun in the economy, remarks that helped send stocks higher.

Markets mostly expect the Fed to enact a second consecutive quarter point, or 25 basis points, rate increase at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting later this month. However, traders are pricing in close to a 30% probability of a higher half-point increase, according to CME Group data.

Powell reiterated that rate decisions will be made “meeting by meeting” and will be dependent on data and their impact on inflation and economic activity, rather than a pre-set course.

Lender SVB Financial Group’s stock plummeted Thursday as it sold securities to realign its portfolio in response to higher interest rates while it manages lower deposit levels from clients who continue to spend cash. 

 The stock (ticker: SIVB ) fell 41.9% to $155.72 by late morning on Thursday. The decline, the steepest among companies in the S&amp;P 500 , put the shares on pace for their largest percentage decrease since Sept. 10, 1998, when they fell 42.3%,

Analysts shared Neutral ratings on the stock.

On Wednesday after the market closed, SVB said it sold all of its $21 billion in securities classified as available for sale, a portfolio essentially comprised of U.S. Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. It said it suffered an after-tax loss of $1.8 billion, to be recorded in the first quarter of 2023, as a result. Prices of fixed-income securities such as MBS and Treasury debt fall as interest rates go up.

 The company plans to reinvest the proceeds from the sale into shorter-term debt to take advantage of rising rates.

“The sale of substantially all of our AFS securities will enable us to increase our asset sensitivity, partially lock in funding costs, better insulate net interest income (NII) and net interest margin (NIM) from the impact of higher interest rates, and enhance profitability,” SVB said.

SVB is also raising $2.25 billion, including $500 million from private-equity firm General Atlantic and by offering $1.25 billion of convertible and common stock to investors.

SVB, parent of Silicon Valley Bank, enjoyed a bull run in 2021 as it lent to venture capitalist-backed start-ups in technology, life sciences and healthcare, and even Napa Valley wineries, in an era of low interest rates and easy money.

SVB’s stock has fallen nearly 80% from its record high in late 2021 as interest rates have increased, boosting the cost of the deposits the bank uses to fund loans. The company in its press release on Wednesday said its latest actions were partly due to expectations for a continued higher interest-rate environment and partly because deposit levels have declined.

Given the current volatile economic environment, venture-capital firms have been less willing to fund startups—a problem for SVB, which gets deposits from VC-backed start-ups that were earlier flush with cash. As of Feb. 28, SVB had client funds of $326 billion, a decline from $341 billion at the end of last year.

“What we learned over the last 12 to 24 months is that in a fast-paced rising rate environment, customer deposit dynamics are different than what we had expected,” said Chief Financial Officer Daniel Beck in a conference call with Bank of America analysts days ahead of Wednesday’s update.

“Concern over a slow-to-recover VC environment have kept us cautious on SIVB shares and potentially remains a headwind as rates stay elevated,” said D.A. Davidson analyst Gary Tenner. He rates the stock at Neutral and lowered his target for the price to $200 from $250.

Wedbush’s David Chiaverini maintained a Neutral stance as well. The analyst said his rating is based on SIVB’s growth normalizing after an exceptional run “and our belief that the VC market could remain challenged for the next couple quarters.”

SVB company said it now expects growth in loans in the high single digits for the full 2023 fiscal year, compared with the double-digit growth it had forecast earlier.",283,119,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11myayr/svb_financial_stock_plummets_after_lender/,"SVB Financial Stock Plummets After Lender Liquidates Portfolio, Cuts Outlook [https://www.barrons.com/articles/svb-financial-stock-portfolio-outlook-loss-93287f3d](https://www.barrons.com/articles/svb-financial-stock-portfolio-outlook-loss-93287f3d?mod=hp_LATEST)

Shares of tech-focused bank SVB Financial plunged by 60% on Thursday after the company announced a plan to raise more than $2 billion in capital to help offset losses on bond sales. Trading on the stock was halted for volatility multiple times during the session, and the drop brought SVB’s market cap below $7 billion. The steepest single day drop in the companies history. 

The company said in a [letter](https://s201.q4cdn.com/589201576/files/doc_downloads/2023/03/r/Q1-2023-Investor-Letter.FINAL-030823.pdf) from CEO Greg Becker on Wednesday that it has sold “substantially all” of its available-for-sale securities and was looking to raise $2.25 billion between common equity and convertible preferred shares. The sale of securities will result in a post-tax earnings loss of $1.8 billion.

The company said in a presentation that it sold off [$21 billion](https://s201.q4cdn.com/589201576/files/doc_downloads/2023/03/Q1-2023-Mid-Quarter-Update-vFINAL3-030823.pdf) in available-for-sale securities. The available-for-sale securities at the end of the fourth quarter were mostly U.S. Treasury's, according to a securities filing. The company also previously reported more than $90 billion in held-to-maturity securities.

The bank cited higher interest rates and “elevated cash burn from our clients” as reasons to raise the new capital. The firm is heavily involved with startup companies, saying on its website that nearly half of all venture-backed tech and life science firms in the U.S. bank with SVB.

The dramatic decline for SVB comes shortly after cryptocurrency-focused bank Silvergate announced liquidation plans. SVB said in its letter that it has minimal exposure to crypto.

**The lender’s problems stemmed partly from age-old banking risks such as concentration and matching assets and liabilities**

Silvergate Capital  was in the newfangled business of cryptocurrency banking. But it  ran into some very old banking problems—which could rattle investors in  traditional lenders, too.

The California bank said Wednesday that it intends to wind down and plans to return all deposits. Though Silvergate’s customers were once cryptocurrency exchanges  such as Coinbase Global and FTX, its core banking activity was actually  quite familiar: holding deposits of ordinary dollars from those  customers and investing in government-backed securities. And therein  lies the concerning part for bank investors.

&amp;#x200B;

Unlike some bank failures of recent memory, Silvergate didn’t  have bad assets in the sense of risky loans or complex derivatives. In  fact, its assets were mostly unassailable things like U.S. Treasurys and  agency mortgage-backed securities. But credit risk—or the risk of not  being paid back—isn’t the only kind of risk banks face. Securities such  as these carry interest-rate risk.

So **when rates surged as the Federal Reserve hiked in 2022,  Treasurys and mortgage bonds plunged in price**. Now if a bank is able to hold on to these securities until they mature,  it doesn’t ultimately lose anything. **The problem comes if a bank needs  to sell them before maturity, crystallizing the losses in their market  value. Silvergate has said it had to sell securities amid its deposit outflows**.

Banks can plan for this risk by aiming to match the duration of  their liabilities, which includes deposits, to their assets. For  example, if a bank is getting funding via a one-year certificate of  deposit, it can buy a Treasury maturing in one year to match. But if a  bank’s deposits can move at any moment, it has to weigh that risk when  investing.

A bank could just keep all its money in cash. But to earn more,  banks need to take more risk. They can manage this by building up a mix  of deposits that don’t all move or reprice at once. This is done by  diversifying across customer and account types, or by adding term  deposits such as CDs. Banks also diversify with assets that are floating  rate, like many kinds of corporate loans or credit card loans.

So most banks aren’t subject to risks of a single industry such  as crypto. Having so much of its funding coming from similar types of  depositors turned out to be one of Silvergate’s biggest risks. But there  are still echoes across banking. For one, the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corp. reports that banks had unrealized losses on securities of about $620 billion as of the fourth quarter. Plus, banks’ deposits are starting to move more quickly,  and against the backdrop of the Fed’s aggressive rate increases and the  unusual postpandemic economy, it isn’t clear exactly what their  ultimate velocity will be. Notably, valuable deposits on which banks don’t pay any interest have been declining.

Banks generally have a number of sources of liquidity and have  diversified over time. Few are at risk of needing to wind down so  quickly. But many may still have to take actions  throttling back on  loan growth or raising more capital if the Fed keeps going and deposits  flee more quickly than anticipated.

Silvergate may have been an unusual bank. But its story carries old lessons that all investors sometimes need to relearn.",40,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11na4jf/silvergate_story_is_about_fundamentals_not_just/,"Silvergate Story Is About Fundamentals, Not Just Crypto (Via [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/silvergates-story-is-about-fundamentals-not-just-crypto-30f08fc6) \-- [non-paywall link here](https://archive.is/mfmai))

Silvergate may have been an unusual bank. But its story carries old lessons that all investors sometimes need to relearn."

#[Dow futures fall following Thursday’s market selloff fueled by banks, U.S. jobs report looms](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/09/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Friday as investors look to upcoming job data for clues into how the Federal Reserve may move forward. The action follows a steep sell-off led by bank shares.
*****
&gt; Dow futures shed 66 points, or 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 futures dipped 0.1%, and Nasdaq-100 futures traded flat.
*****
&gt; Shares of the SVB Financial tumbled again on Friday, down another 63% after initially plunging on plans to raise more than $2 billion in capital in a bid to offset losses from bond sales.
*****
&gt; The move weighed on the financial sector and banking stocks, with the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF down more than 2%. Shares of First Republic and Signature Bank were last down about 18% and 12%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Wall Street posted a losing session Thursday. A drop in SVB Financial shares spurred a broad financial sector selloff, as investors grew concerned that higher interest rates would result in banks facing losses on loans due to borrower defaults. The selloff pushed the S&amp;P’s financial sector down 4.1% for its worst day since 2020.
*****
&gt; On Thursday, the Nasdaq Composite recorded a 2.05% slide, while the S&amp;P 500 posted a 1.85% dip. The Dow lost 543.54 points, or 1.66%, as the 30-stock index closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time since Nov. 9. All three major averages are on pace to finish the week down 3% or more.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is bracing for February jobs report, which is slated to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect nonfarm payrolls to rise 225,000 in the month, which would mark a slowdown in growth from January’s unexpectedly large gain of 517,000.
*****
&gt; The unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged from January — when it hit a low not seen since 1969 — at 3.4%, according to Dow Jones. Hourly wages are expected to have increased 0.4% from the prior month, gaining 4.8% from 12 months ago, economists estimate.
*****
&gt; While having more jobs is considered good for the economy, a better-than-expected report can push stocks lower, according to Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. That’s because more workers can signal more demand, he said, which would indicate higher inflation.
*****
&gt; Traders are pricing in a roughly 63% chance of the Federal Reserve raising rates by half of a percentage point at its next policy meeting in about two weeks, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Investors see Friday’s job report as a key driver in that decision, given the central bank’s continued focus on the strength of the labor market as a justification for rate increases.
*****
&gt; “A strong report would be bad news for the Fed, for interest rates, and for markets,” McMillan said.

A drop in SVB Financial shares spurred a broad financial sector selloff, as investors grew concerned that higher interest rates would result in banks facing losses on loans due to borrower defaults. The selloff pushed the S&amp;P’s financial sector down 4.1% for its worst day since 2020.
*****
&gt; On Thursday, the Nasdaq Composite recorded a 2.05% slide, while the S&amp;P 500 posted a 1.85% dip. The Dow lost 543.54 points, or 1.66%, as the 30-stock index closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time since Nov. 9. All three major averages are on pace to finish the week down 3% or more.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is bracing for February jobs report, which is slated to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect nonfarm payrolls to rise 225,000 in the month, which would mark a slowdown in growth from January’s unexpectedly large gain of 517,000.
*****
&gt; The unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged from January — when it hit a low not seen since 1969 — at 3.4%, according to Dow Jones. Hourly wages are expected to have increased 0.4% from the prior month, gaining 4.8% from 12 months ago, economists estimate.
*****
&gt; While having more jobs is considered good for the economy, a better-than-expected report can push stocks lower, according to Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. That’s because more workers can signal more demand, he said, which would indicate higher inflation.
*****
&gt; Traders are pricing in a roughly 63% chance of the Federal Reserve raising rates by half of a percentage point at its next policy meeting in about two weeks, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Investors see Friday’s job report as a key driver in that decision, given the central bank’s continued focus on the strength of the labor market as a justification for rate increases.
*****
&gt; “A strong report would be bad news for the Fed, for interest rates, and for markets,” McMillan said.

SVB Financial, parent of Silicon Valley Bank, is in talks to sell itself, sources told CNBC’s David Faber.

Attempts by the bank to raise capital have failed, the sources said, and the bank has hired advisors to explore a potential sale.

Large financial institutions are taking a look at a potential purchase of SVB. However, deposits outflows are so far outpacing the sale process, making it very difficult for a realistic assessment of the bank by potential buyers to take place, the sources told Faber.

Shares of the bank fell 60% on Thursday after SVB announced a plan Wednesday evening to raise more than $2 billion in capital. The stock fell another 60% in premarket trading Friday before being halted for pending news. The shares did not open for trading with the rest of the market at 9:30 a.m. and were still halted.

Under the terms of a plan released Wednesday, SVB was looking to sell $1.25 billion in common stock and another $500 million of convertible preferred shares.

SVB also announced a deal with investment firm General Atlantic to sell $500 million of common stock, though that agreement was contingent on the closing of the other common stock offering, according to a securities filing.

SVB is a major bank for venture-backed companies, and cited cash burn from clients as one reason it was looking to raise additional capital.

However, rising interest rates, fears of a recession and a slowdown in the market for initial public offerings has made it harder for early stage companies to raise more cash. This has apparently led the firms to draw down on their deposits at banks like SVB.

Wall Street analysts said on Thursday and Friday that the troubles at SVB seemed unlikely to spread widely throughout the banking system. Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients that SVB’s issues were “highly idiosyncratic.”

Also on Wednesday, SVB announced that it sold $21 billion worth of securities to raise cash and reposition its balance sheet toward assets with shorter duration, which are less exposed to rising interest rates. SVB estimated that it took a $1.8 billion loss on that sale.

That leaves $SBNY, either filling silvergates void or joining its fate. If they are in trouble, I don't know who would want to bail them out. Puts priced kinda ok but they would need to go bust soon for a good pay off. Edit: Currently in the lead in terms of decline. Might be the one.

Maybe printing new shares might save them, maybe not. Stock price will be in the gutter anyways.

As you’ve heard the bank has gone into bankruptcy protection essentially.

Reason being was that the bank invested depositors money into long term bonds. Those bonds value dropped as interest rates have been rising causing them to lack enough asset backing to match the amount of depositor money in the bank.

People ask for their money and they don’t have enough.

Bank run. 

Curious, the way this bank went under doesn’t seem to be because of greed or anything like that. They invested in conservative assets like bonds and went under.

What’s the difference then between how this bank works and how the top five like TD do?

11o2hd6,2023-03-10 22:11:05,investing,Prestigious_Risk7610,how to assess the impacts of SVB collapse,"I'm not going to go into background and context, just so I can manage the post length.

My simple question is what will be the impact of the collapse?  I'll set out my thoughts, but really I want to prompt a conversation that people add to - i.e. I'd prefer to hear people's view (ideally with data) rather than just hear that I'm right or wrong.

Impact on banks
- SVB is pretty unique so there should be no/limited copycat fails
- however, lots of banks have 'hold to maturity' bonds.  These are not priced MTM, so haven't been reflected in P&amp;Ls.  That's not a problem, as long as they don't need to sell.
- the reason they'd need to sell would be to fund outflows (i.e. deposit withdrawals or new lending)

My conclusion is there is limited impact.  I don't see further withdrawal runs.  At the margin I could see some banks being cautious about new lending, but I can't see it being a major issue.


Impact on SVB customers
- most of the customers are VC backed startups or those that have exited onto the public markets.  There aren't many retail customers, and those few retail customers are mostly founders.
- this means 93% of deposits aren't FDIC insured
- clearly not all of this money is lost, as the HTM assets will be sold down in time, but the question is what haircut is taken, and when it gets paid out?
- the issue I see is that lots of VC backed businesses are cashflow negative and have been trying to draw out their reserves to reach a better funding environment once The Fed pivots.  So many are running low on cash anyway, and now they've lost access to a chunk of funds from (often) their primary banking relationship.  Even worse, their owners (VC/PE funds) have limited ability to chip in funds because a chunk of their funds are frozen as they banked with SVB.

My conclusion is that we could see many tech companies be stressed.  It will bring forward either the execution of fundraises, but only the strongest will be able to compete for relatively limited capital.  The middling strength will substantially cut back on cash burn (i.e. layoffs).  The weakest will fail, although not necessarily immediately.  I see this having a meaningful and pretty swift impact on the economy


Impact on consumers
- limited immediate impacts from SVB collapse due to few retail accounts
- however, I'd expect those tech layoffs will hit households
- but tech (particularly the start up end) is not a large employer (although it is in certain locations)
-start ups are not systemically important so limited impact on consumers day to day life
- VC funds will take significant write downs, and so will the investors.  But as these investors skew heavily to the top of the wealth scale it probably won't impact spending in the economy

My conclusion is that, at the margin we'll see unemployment tick up and a drag on consumer spending, but unlikely to see much happen


Overall, I see this being very bad for early stage tech (and its employees), but limited impact on other banks or the economy as a whole.

# **Dow closes more than 300 points lower, posts worst week since June as Silicon Valley Bank collapse sparks selloff: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/09/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks tumbled Friday as tech-focused lender Silicon Valley Bank shut down following losses in its bond portfolio, prompting the biggest bank failure since the global financial crisis and sending shockwaves through the banking sector.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped for a fourth consecutive day, finishing 345.22 points lower, or 1.07%, to close at 31,909.64. The S&amp;P 500 lost 1.45% to settle at 3,861.59. The Nasdaq Composite shed 1.76% to end at 11,138.89.
*****
&gt; All the major averages capped off the week with losses. The Dow fell 4.44% to post its worst weekly performance since June. The S&amp;P dropped 4.55%, while the Nasdaq lost 4.71%.
*****
&gt; Regulators took control of Silicon Valley Bank on Friday, after shares tumbled Thursday and the bank struggled on Friday to find another company to buy it. Regional bank stocks tumbled in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank’s demise, with the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF lost nearly 4.4%. For the week, the regional bank fund lost about 16%, its worst week since March 2020 as the pandemic hit.
*****
&gt; “You had a major U.S. bank collapse, the biggest bank failure since 2008, inevitably that’s going to spook the market,” said Sylvia Jablonski, CEO and chief investment officer of Defiance ETFs. The failure, she added, is also fueling concern among investors over whether the contagion spreads beyond SVB.
*****
&gt; Several bank stocks were repeatedly halted on Friday, including First Republic, PacWest and c/rypto-focused Signature Bank. First Republic dropped 14.8%, and PacWest shed 37.9%. Some bellwether bank stocks suffered smaller losses even as SVB’s fallout wreaked havoc on regional names. Goldman Sachs and Bank of America fell 4.2% and 0.9% respectively. JPMorgan held onto a 2.5% gain.
*****
&gt; “This is gamebook play, where traders and shorter term investors don’t want to be long over the weekend,” said Rich Steinberg, chief market strategist at The Colony Group.
*****
&gt; The turmoil among bank stocks overshadowed a February jobs report, which gave some hints that inflation could be slowing. Payrolls increased more than expected, but investors focused on the smaller-than-expected gain in wages, which may cause the Federal Reserve to rethink its aggressive stance on rate hikes.

&gt; # Payrolls Strong but Unemployment Rises: All Mixed Up

&gt; Another month, another solid employment report. Employment rose by 311,000 in February, on the back of 504,000 in January and 239,000 in December. It’s certainly been a warm winter. This is the labor market that refuses to give in, despite the Fed throwing almost 500 bps (5%-points) of rate hikes at it and gearing up for more.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-10-payrolls-1202x1600.png))**

&gt; # But the unemployment rate rose …
&gt; Yes, the unemployment rate rose to 3.6%, up from 3.4% in January. However, that was entirely for positive reasons.

&gt; The unemployment rate, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) measures it, is the number of people unemployed who are looking for work divided by the size of the labor force. Last month, the number of unemployed people that are looking for work rose by about 240,000. However, that’s because 419,000 people “entered” the labor force, i.e., started looking for work. That’s a sign of a healthy labor market. People will start looking for work only if they think they can get a job.

&gt; The labor force measure has issues related to how participation is measured – they count someone as being in the labor force only if someone is looking for work. But a lot of people may not do so for any number of reasons, including not feeling confident in the job market or non-economic reasons like not having access to childcare. The measure also can fall over time because of a lot of retiring baby-boomers.

&gt; One way to get around these issues is to look at the employment-population ratio for prime age workers, i.e., workers aged 25-54 years. This measures the number of people working as a percent of the civilian population – think of it as the opposite of the unemployment rate, and because we use prime age, you get around the demographic issue as well.

&gt; The good news is that the prime-age employment-population ratio just hit 80.5%, which is close to the highest level we’ve seen in a couple of decades.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-10-e-pop-ratio-1203x1600.png))**

&gt; It helps to recall that we just had a multi-generational black swan event in the form of a pandemic. But once everything re-opened, the expectation was that things would bounce back immediately. And a lot of numbers did, including GDP, employment, and consumption.

&gt; However, there were also a lot of people who left the labor force amid the pandemic. And what we’re seeing now is that each month there’s a continuous flow of people back into the labor force, and these people are finding jobs quickly. Just over the past six months, 1.5 million more people have come into the labor force as prospects for finding a job improve.

&gt; Make no mistake, this is a really strong labor market in my opinion.

&gt; # Is the labor market too strong?
&gt; It’s weird to even ask that question, but it matters for the Federal Reserve. In their model for the economy, they see a tight labor market as one that results in stronger wage growth. And strong wage growth can drive demand higher, pushing up prices and inflation.

&gt; Well, hopefully, they can rest a little easy on that front. Average hourly earnings rose just 0.2% in February. Over the past three months, wages have been growing at an annualized pace of 3.6%, well below the 6%+ pace we saw last year. It’s getting very close to the pre-pandemic pace of 3.1%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-10-ahe-3m-change-1212x1600.png))**

&gt; This backs up other evidence that wage growth is indeed easing, including the Employment Cost Index, which is the gold standard of wage growth measures. The ECI was running at an annualized pace of 4.2% in Q4 2022, down from 4.8% in Q3. The January-February hourly earnings data suggest that wage growth continues to decelerate.

&gt; The big question is whether the Fed buys this. Powell’s comments this week in front of Congress did not inspire confidence. It looks like a string of hot economic data has left them questioning their decision to ease the pace of rate increases from 50 bps to 25 bps (as of February) – and wondering if they should move that back up to 50 bps at their March meeting. At this point, markets think the outcome is a coin toss, which is not great as Powell simply injected maximum uncertainty into markets.

&gt; But looking beyond the Fed’s March meeting, the big picture is that the labor market appears to remain really strong. This means the economy also remains strong, and that’s not a bad thing as far as markets are concerned. Though it also means the Fed is likely to keep interest rates higher for longer.

*****

&gt; # Panic! At the Fed?

&gt; Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s comments this week during his semi-annual testimony in front of Congress did not inspire much confidence with respect to the path for monetary policy. It seems like Fed officials’ are confused as to what they want to do next.

&gt; Case in point: last month, Powell said that the “disinflationary process has started.”

&gt; Since then, we’ve had a run of strong economic data, including January payrolls, retail sales, and inflation. And it looks like that was enough to spook the Fed. The shift was clear in Powell’s statements this week:

&gt; “Inflationary pressures are running higher than expected at the time of our previous Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.”

&gt; And

&gt; “The ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated.”

&gt; At the same time, he also said:

&gt; “If – and I stress that no decision has been made on this — if the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes.”

&gt; Markets were clearly taken aback by his comments, with equities falling 1.5% on Tuesday (March 7th) and rate hike expectations rising.

&gt; This becomes clear if you look at expectations for their March meeting. Last Friday, markets were expecting a 0.25% increase in the federal funds rate, pricing the probability of that at 72%.

&gt; That’s shifted significantly since Powell’s comments this week. Investors moved the probability of a 0.25% increase down to 28%, and the probability of a 0.50% increase rose to almost 80%.

&gt; This is a huge shift, especially this close to a meeting. Typically, the couple of weeks prior to the meeting is a “quiet period,” where Fed officials don’t give speeches or comments, i.e., anything that may lead to a shift in expectations. The last time this happened was in June 2022, when the Wall Street Journal reported that the Fed was considering raising rates by 0.75% instead of the 0.50% they guided markets toward.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-09-March-rate-hike-expectations-1202x1600.png))**

&gt; # There’s not much reason to panic
&gt; To be clear, the January data was hotter than expected. But this is just one month of data and is likely a rebound from the relatively soft December data (which, at the time, led to increased recession calls) and perhaps positive weather-related effects.

&gt; We’re yet to get February data, but it’s hard to believe the string of hot data continues into February and March.

&gt; Take vehicle sales, for example. Sales surged 19% in January to a 15.9 million annualized pace, the highest since May 2021. But sales pulled back to 14.9 million in February. So the trend is still positive, but nothing suggests that the economy is overheating to the extent that the Fed has to up-end market expectations for upcoming policy.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-09-auto-sales.png))**

&gt; The Carson Investment Research team has been in the camp that the economy will avoid a recession this year. As we’ve discussed before, we believe consumers are in good shape, and real incomes are rising, which should keep consumption humming along.

&gt; This gets to the point that we don’t see the Fed cutting rates any time soon. Expectations for the terminal rate, i.e., the highest rate the Fed will get to, also rose this week. At the beginning of the year, investors expected the terminal rate to end up around 4.9%. That’s now increased to about 5.6% on the back of strong economic data.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-09-rate-expectations-1202x1600.png))**

&gt; The good news is that, at the end of the day, positive economic data is positive. This perhaps explains why equities have remained resilient this year. The S&amp;P 500 is up just under 4% year-to-date, despite rate expectations repricing higher.

&gt; That’s a big shift from last year and a positive one. And we believe equities have the potential to remain resilient, even as the economic data (and the Fed) swing back and forth.

&gt; # This Doesn't Happen Often

&gt; After a surge earlier this week that took the yield on the two-year US Treasury up above 5% for the first time since 2007, concerns over the health of bank balance sheets have caused a sharp reversal lower. From a closing high of 5.07% on Wednesday, the yield on the two-year US Treasury has plummeted to 4.62% and is on pace for its largest two-day decline since September 2008. Remember that?

&gt; A 45 basis point (bps) two-day decline in the two-year yield has been extremely uncommon over the last 46 years. Of the 79 prior occurrences, two-thirds occurred during recessions, and the only times that a move of this magnitude did not occur either within six months before or after a recession were during the crash of 1987 (10/19 and 10/20) as well as 10/13/89 when the leveraged buyout of United Airlines fell through, resulting in a collapse of the junk bond market. As you can see from the New York Times headline the day after that 1989 plunge, just as investors are worrying today over whether we're in for a repeat of the Financial Crisis, back then they were looking at 'troubling similarities' to the 1987 crash. The year that followed the October 1989 decline wasn't a particularly positive period for equities, but a repeat of anything close to the 1987 crash never materialized.

&gt; # 50-DMAs Couldn't Hold

&gt; Worries about banks today left major US index ETFs across the market cap spectrum back below their 50-day moving averages. The uptrend channels that have been formed over the last six months are also getting tested with this week's move lower. You can see the current set-ups in the snapshot from our Chart Scanner tool below.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/50days.png))**

&gt; Looking at our Trend Analyzer, every sector ETF except for Technology has now moved back below its 50-day moving average. Six of eleven sectors are actually oversold (&gt;1 standard deviation below 50-DMA), with Financials (XLF) and Health Care (XLV) at ""extreme oversold"" levels. XLF had been up more than 8% on the year about a month ago, but it's now down 1.93% YTD.

&gt; Technology (XLK) and Utilities (XLU) are the only two sectors up over the last week. Interestingly, Utilities (XLU) has been one of the worst performing sectors so far this year, while Tech has been the best.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/ussectoretfs.png))**

&gt; With Financials seeing such a sharp decline this week, below is a snapshot of various banks and brokers in the sector with the ones highlighted in red all now trading at least 5% below their 50-DMA. As shown, Charles Schwab (SCHW) is down the most over the last week with a decline of 12.6%, which has left it 16.4% below its 50-DMA and down nearly 20% on the year. Other names like Bank of America (BAC), JP Morgan (JPM), and Raymond James (RJF) are in extreme oversold territory as well. Of the major banks and brokers listed, Goldman Sachs (GS) has actually held up the best over the last week with a decline of just 2%.

&gt; # Bearish Sentiment Remains

&gt; The S&amp;P 500's swings higher and then lower over the past week have left sentiment little changed. For the American Association of Individual Investors' (AAII) weekly survey, 24.8% of respondents reporting as bullish compared to 23.4% the previous week. That is the second higher reading in a row but still well below the recent high of 37.5% from one month ago.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030923-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; Along with a modest bounce in bullishness, bearish sentiment has taken a modest decline falling from a recent high of 44.8% last week down to 41.7% today. That is the first decline in a month, leaving it in the middle of its range since the start of last year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030923-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; Given the moves in bullish and bearish sentiment, the bull-bear spread remains skewed in favor of bears for the third week in a row.

&gt; Following a sharp eight percentage point decline last week, neutral sentiment has bounced rising to 33.4%. Albeit higher, outside of last week, that reading would be the lowest since the end of 2022.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030923-AAII-4.png))**

&gt; Although recent weeks have seen the AAII survey return to deeply bearish sentiment, other surveys are not nearly as pessimistic. While the AAII survey's bull-bear spread sits well over a standard deviation below its historical average, the NAAIM Exposure index continues to show only modestly long positioning among active managers. Currently, that reading is 0.2 standard deviations below the historical norm. Meanwhile, the weekly Investors Intelligence survey is actually showing respondents are reporting as more bullish than has been historically normal.

&gt; # A Closer Look at Seasonality

&gt; We talked a lot about how February (especially the second half of February) could be a potential break for stocks, well the good news is that we now see many signs of better times potentially coming soon.

&gt; Here’s what the average year for the S&amp;P 500 looks like. Looking at the chart below, the blue line shows gains from January through April, and November and December are normal. It is the middle part of the year that stocks tend to struggle.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-164.png))**

&gt; Lately, things look a little different. Looking at only the past 20 years showed that stocks tended to bottom in March. This is likely due to major bear market lows taking place during this month in 2003, 2009, and 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-273.jpg))**

&gt; We’ve shared before that pre-election years tend to be strong for stocks, lower only twice going back to World War II and up nearly 17% on average, making this historically the strongest year of the 4-year Presidential cycle. Looking at these years it is once again common to see the second half of February weakness and a tradeable low in late February.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-321.jpg))**

&gt; Building on this, we found that pre-election years of a new President do even better, up close to 20% on average. But wouldn’t you know it, right about now tended to be a consolidation period before late March and April strength.

&gt; What about years that started off with big gains? When stocks gained more than 5% in January (like 2023) we found that a consolidation period took place now and into April. The good news is that eventual gains of close to 23% on average were how things ended up, suggesting any potential consolidation here could potentially be used as an opportunity.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-599.png))**

&gt; Lastly, I’ve seen other places combine many of the things I’ve just discussed and make one composite combining them all. I did that and we called it the Carson Cycle Composite. This proprietary composite looks at the average year, pre-election years, pre-election years under a new President, the past 20 years, and years that had a 5% January. As you can see, this year started off stronger, but as of early March is right in line with what the average composite looks like. Take note, a gain of 15.6% is what has been the average Carson Cycle Composite.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-640.png))**

&gt; The bottom line is many cycles suggest the potential for some type of a consolidation here and now would be perfectly normal, but the likelihood of strength before the end of the year is quite strong.

# **Dow closes more than 300 points lower, posts worst week since June as Silicon Valley Bank collapse sparks selloff: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/09/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks tumbled Friday as tech-focused lender Silicon Valley Bank shut down following losses in its bond portfolio, prompting the biggest bank failure since the global financial crisis and sending shockwaves through the banking sector.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped for a fourth consecutive day, finishing 345.22 points lower, or 1.07%, to close at 31,909.64. The S&amp;P 500 lost 1.45% to settle at 3,861.59. The Nasdaq Composite shed 1.76% to end at 11,138.89.
*****
&gt; All the major averages capped off the week with losses. The Dow fell 4.44% to post its worst weekly performance since June. The S&amp;P dropped 4.55%, while the Nasdaq lost 4.71%.
*****
&gt; Regulators took control of Silicon Valley Bank on Friday, after shares tumbled Thursday and the bank struggled on Friday to find another company to buy it. Regional bank stocks tumbled in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank’s demise, with the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF lost nearly 4.4%. For the week, the regional bank fund lost about 16%, its worst week since March 2020 as the pandemic hit.
*****
&gt; “You had a major U.S. bank collapse, the biggest bank failure since 2008, inevitably that’s going to spook the market,” said Sylvia Jablonski, CEO and chief investment officer of Defiance ETFs. The failure, she added, is also fueling concern among investors over whether the contagion spreads beyond SVB.
*****
&gt; Several bank stocks were repeatedly halted on Friday, including First Republic, PacWest and c/rypto-focused Signature Bank. First Republic dropped 14.8%, and PacWest shed 37.9%. Some bellwether bank stocks suffered smaller losses even as SVB’s fallout wreaked havoc on regional names. Goldman Sachs and Bank of America fell 4.2% and 0.9% respectively. JPMorgan held onto a 2.5% gain.
*****
&gt; “This is gamebook play, where traders and shorter term investors don’t want to be long over the weekend,” said Rich Steinberg, chief market strategist at The Colony Group.
*****
&gt; The turmoil among bank stocks overshadowed a February jobs report, which gave some hints that inflation could be slowing. Payrolls increased more than expected, but investors focused on the smaller-than-expected gain in wages, which may cause the Federal Reserve to rethink its aggressive stance on rate hikes.

&gt; # Payrolls Strong but Unemployment Rises: All Mixed Up

&gt; Another month, another solid employment report. Employment rose by 311,000 in February, on the back of 504,000 in January and 239,000 in December. It’s certainly been a warm winter. This is the labor market that refuses to give in, despite the Fed throwing almost 500 bps (5%-points) of rate hikes at it and gearing up for more.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-10-payrolls-1202x1600.png))**

&gt; # But the unemployment rate rose …
&gt; Yes, the unemployment rate rose to 3.6%, up from 3.4% in January. However, that was entirely for positive reasons.

&gt; The unemployment rate, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) measures it, is the number of people unemployed who are looking for work divided by the size of the labor force. Last month, the number of unemployed people that are looking for work rose by about 240,000. However, that’s because 419,000 people “entered” the labor force, i.e., started looking for work. That’s a sign of a healthy labor market. People will start looking for work only if they think they can get a job.

&gt; The labor force measure has issues related to how participation is measured – they count someone as being in the labor force only if someone is looking for work. But a lot of people may not do so for any number of reasons, including not feeling confident in the job market or non-economic reasons like not having access to childcare. The measure also can fall over time because of a lot of retiring baby-boomers.

&gt; One way to get around these issues is to look at the employment-population ratio for prime age workers, i.e., workers aged 25-54 years. This measures the number of people working as a percent of the civilian population – think of it as the opposite of the unemployment rate, and because we use prime age, you get around the demographic issue as well.

&gt; The good news is that the prime-age employment-population ratio just hit 80.5%, which is close to the highest level we’ve seen in a couple of decades.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-10-e-pop-ratio-1203x1600.png))**

&gt; It helps to recall that we just had a multi-generational black swan event in the form of a pandemic. But once everything re-opened, the expectation was that things would bounce back immediately. And a lot of numbers did, including GDP, employment, and consumption.

&gt; However, there were also a lot of people who left the labor force amid the pandemic. And what we’re seeing now is that each month there’s a continuous flow of people back into the labor force, and these people are finding jobs quickly. Just over the past six months, 1.5 million more people have come into the labor force as prospects for finding a job improve.

&gt; Make no mistake, this is a really strong labor market in my opinion.

&gt; # Is the labor market too strong?
&gt; It’s weird to even ask that question, but it matters for the Federal Reserve. In their model for the economy, they see a tight labor market as one that results in stronger wage growth. And strong wage growth can drive demand higher, pushing up prices and inflation.

&gt; Well, hopefully, they can rest a little easy on that front. Average hourly earnings rose just 0.2% in February. Over the past three months, wages have been growing at an annualized pace of 3.6%, well below the 6%+ pace we saw last year. It’s getting very close to the pre-pandemic pace of 3.1%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-10-ahe-3m-change-1212x1600.png))**

&gt; This backs up other evidence that wage growth is indeed easing, including the Employment Cost Index, which is the gold standard of wage growth measures. The ECI was running at an annualized pace of 4.2% in Q4 2022, down from 4.8% in Q3. The January-February hourly earnings data suggest that wage growth continues to decelerate.

&gt; The big question is whether the Fed buys this. Powell’s comments this week in front of Congress did not inspire confidence. It looks like a string of hot economic data has left them questioning their decision to ease the pace of rate increases from 50 bps to 25 bps (as of February) – and wondering if they should move that back up to 50 bps at their March meeting. At this point, markets think the outcome is a coin toss, which is not great as Powell simply injected maximum uncertainty into markets.

&gt; But looking beyond the Fed’s March meeting, the big picture is that the labor market appears to remain really strong. This means the economy also remains strong, and that’s not a bad thing as far as markets are concerned. Though it also means the Fed is likely to keep interest rates higher for longer.

*****

&gt; # Panic! At the Fed?

&gt; Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s comments this week during his semi-annual testimony in front of Congress did not inspire much confidence with respect to the path for monetary policy. It seems like Fed officials’ are confused as to what they want to do next.

&gt; Case in point: last month, Powell said that the “disinflationary process has started.”

&gt; Since then, we’ve had a run of strong economic data, including January payrolls, retail sales, and inflation. And it looks like that was enough to spook the Fed. The shift was clear in Powell’s statements this week:

&gt; “Inflationary pressures are running higher than expected at the time of our previous Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.”

&gt; And

&gt; “The ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated.”

&gt; At the same time, he also said:

&gt; “If – and I stress that no decision has been made on this — if the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes.”

&gt; Markets were clearly taken aback by his comments, with equities falling 1.5% on Tuesday (March 7th) and rate hike expectations rising.

&gt; This becomes clear if you look at expectations for their March meeting. Last Friday, markets were expecting a 0.25% increase in the federal funds rate, pricing the probability of that at 72%.

&gt; That’s shifted significantly since Powell’s comments this week. Investors moved the probability of a 0.25% increase down to 28%, and the probability of a 0.50% increase rose to almost 80%.

&gt; This is a huge shift, especially this close to a meeting. Typically, the couple of weeks prior to the meeting is a “quiet period,” where Fed officials don’t give speeches or comments, i.e., anything that may lead to a shift in expectations. The last time this happened was in June 2022, when the Wall Street Journal reported that the Fed was considering raising rates by 0.75% instead of the 0.50% they guided markets toward.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-09-March-rate-hike-expectations-1202x1600.png))**

&gt; # There’s not much reason to panic
&gt; To be clear, the January data was hotter than expected. But this is just one month of data and is likely a rebound from the relatively soft December data (which, at the time, led to increased recession calls) and perhaps positive weather-related effects.

&gt; We’re yet to get February data, but it’s hard to believe the string of hot data continues into February and March.

&gt; Take vehicle sales, for example. Sales surged 19% in January to a 15.9 million annualized pace, the highest since May 2021. But sales pulled back to 14.9 million in February. So the trend is still positive, but nothing suggests that the economy is overheating to the extent that the Fed has to up-end market expectations for upcoming policy.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-09-auto-sales.png))**

&gt; The Carson Investment Research team has been in the camp that the economy will avoid a recession this year. As we’ve discussed before, we believe consumers are in good shape, and real incomes are rising, which should keep consumption humming along.

&gt; This gets to the point that we don’t see the Fed cutting rates any time soon. Expectations for the terminal rate, i.e., the highest rate the Fed will get to, also rose this week. At the beginning of the year, investors expected the terminal rate to end up around 4.9%. That’s now increased to about 5.6% on the back of strong economic data.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-09-rate-expectations-1202x1600.png))**

&gt; The good news is that, at the end of the day, positive economic data is positive. This perhaps explains why equities have remained resilient this year. The S&amp;P 500 is up just under 4% year-to-date, despite rate expectations repricing higher.

&gt; That’s a big shift from last year and a positive one. And we believe equities have the potential to remain resilient, even as the economic data (and the Fed) swing back and forth.

*****

&gt; # This Doesn't Happen Often

&gt; After a surge earlier this week that took the yield on the two-year US Treasury up above 5% for the first time since 2007, concerns over the health of bank balance sheets have caused a sharp reversal lower. From a closing high of 5.07% on Wednesday, the yield on the two-year US Treasury has plummeted to 4.62% and is on pace for its largest two-day decline since September 2008. Remember that?

&gt; A 45 basis point (bps) two-day decline in the two-year yield has been extremely uncommon over the last 46 years. Of the 79 prior occurrences, two-thirds occurred during recessions, and the only times that a move of this magnitude did not occur either within six months before or after a recession were during the crash of 1987 (10/19 and 10/20) as well as 10/13/89 when the leveraged buyout of United Airlines fell through, resulting in a collapse of the junk bond market. As you can see from the New York Times headline the day after that 1989 plunge, just as investors are worrying today over whether we're in for a repeat of the Financial Crisis, back then they were looking at 'troubling similarities' to the 1987 crash. The year that followed the October 1989 decline wasn't a particularly positive period for equities, but a repeat of anything close to the 1987 crash never materialized.

&gt; # 50-DMAs Couldn't Hold

&gt; Worries about banks today left major US index ETFs across the market cap spectrum back below their 50-day moving averages. The uptrend channels that have been formed over the last six months are also getting tested with this week's move lower. You can see the current set-ups in the snapshot from our Chart Scanner tool below.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/50days.png))**

&gt; Looking at our Trend Analyzer, every sector ETF except for Technology has now moved back below its 50-day moving average. Six of eleven sectors are actually oversold (&gt;1 standard deviation below 50-DMA), with Financials (XLF) and Health Care (XLV) at ""extreme oversold"" levels. XLF had been up more than 8% on the year about a month ago, but it's now down 1.93% YTD.

&gt; Technology (XLK) and Utilities (XLU) are the only two sectors up over the last week. Interestingly, Utilities (XLU) has been one of the worst performing sectors so far this year, while Tech has been the best.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/ussectoretfs.png))**

&gt; With Financials seeing such a sharp decline this week, below is a snapshot of various banks and brokers in the sector with the ones highlighted in red all now trading at least 5% below their 50-DMA. As shown, Charles Schwab (SCHW) is down the most over the last week with a decline of 12.6%, which has left it 16.4% below its 50-DMA and down nearly 20% on the year. Other names like Bank of America (BAC), JP Morgan (JPM), and Raymond James (RJF) are in extreme oversold territory as well. Of the major banks and brokers listed, Goldman Sachs (GS) has actually held up the best over the last week with a decline of just 2%.

&gt; # Bearish Sentiment Remains

&gt; The S&amp;P 500's swings higher and then lower over the past week have left sentiment little changed. For the American Association of Individual Investors' (AAII) weekly survey, 24.8% of respondents reporting as bullish compared to 23.4% the previous week. That is the second higher reading in a row but still well below the recent high of 37.5% from one month ago.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030923-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; Along with a modest bounce in bullishness, bearish sentiment has taken a modest decline falling from a recent high of 44.8% last week down to 41.7% today. That is the first decline in a month, leaving it in the middle of its range since the start of last year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030923-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; Given the moves in bullish and bearish sentiment, the bull-bear spread remains skewed in favor of bears for the third week in a row.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030923-AAII-3.png))**

&gt; Following a sharp eight percentage point decline last week, neutral sentiment has bounced rising to 33.4%. Albeit higher, outside of last week, that reading would be the lowest since the end of 2022.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030923-AAII-4.png))**

&gt; Although recent weeks have seen the AAII survey return to deeply bearish sentiment, other surveys are not nearly as pessimistic. While the AAII survey's bull-bear spread sits well over a standard deviation below its historical average, the NAAIM Exposure index continues to show only modestly long positioning among active managers. Currently, that reading is 0.2 standard deviations below the historical norm. Meanwhile, the weekly Investors Intelligence survey is actually showing respondents are reporting as more bullish than has been historically normal.

&gt; # A Closer Look at Seasonality

&gt; We talked a lot about how February (especially the second half of February) could be a potential break for stocks, well the good news is that we now see many signs of better times potentially coming soon.

&gt; Here’s what the average year for the S&amp;P 500 looks like. Looking at the chart below, the blue line shows gains from January through April, and November and December are normal. It is the middle part of the year that stocks tend to struggle.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-164.png))**

&gt; Lately, things look a little different. Looking at only the past 20 years showed that stocks tended to bottom in March. This is likely due to major bear market lows taking place during this month in 2003, 2009, and 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-273.jpg))**

&gt; We’ve shared before that pre-election years tend to be strong for stocks, lower only twice going back to World War II and up nearly 17% on average, making this historically the strongest year of the 4-year Presidential cycle. Looking at these years it is once again common to see the second half of February weakness and a tradeable low in late February.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-321.jpg))**

&gt; Building on this, we found that pre-election years of a new President do even better, up close to 20% on average. But wouldn’t you know it, right about now tended to be a consolidation period before late March and April strength.

&gt; What about years that started off with big gains? When stocks gained more than 5% in January (like 2023) we found that a consolidation period took place now and into April. The good news is that eventual gains of close to 23% on average were how things ended up, suggesting any potential consolidation here could potentially be used as an opportunity.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-599.png))**

&gt; Lastly, I’ve seen other places combine many of the things I’ve just discussed and make one composite combining them all. I did that and we called it the Carson Cycle Composite. This proprietary composite looks at the average year, pre-election years, pre-election years under a new President, the past 20 years, and years that had a 5% January. As you can see, this year started off stronger, but as of early March is right in line with what the average composite looks like. Take note, a gain of 15.6% is what has been the average Carson Cycle Composite.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-640.png))**

&gt; The bottom line is many cycles suggest the potential for some type of a consolidation here and now would be perfectly normal, but the likelihood of strength before the end of the year is quite strong.

11o5jer,2023-03-11 00:17:55,wallstreetbets,zulufux999,How major US banks could be at risk of sweeping defaults,"
With the recent implosion of SVB (Silicon Valley Bank), it's important to start looking under the rug before all of the roaches start running all over the place. In a nutshell, we know a few things have happened:

1. Trillions of dollars were printed and we aren't going to escape the effects of it.
2. Interest rates are up enough to really start killing off borrowing demand, to the tune of 20% volume of mortgage starts versus one year ago.
3. US consumer credit debt is way up, and personal savings are way down.
4. Treasuries are paying 4.5%+ and mortgages are up near 7%. Companies with too large of a disparity between what they pay out in corporate bonds and what they receive from risk free interest will be especially in danger, much like SVB.
5. If you look here- [https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h8/current/default.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h8/current/default.htm) you'll find that all the major US commercial banks have about $2T in residual (assets minus liabilities), about a 10% margin over their liabilities. Assets=22T, Liabilities=20T.

All it takes to start forcing banks to sell assets is 2 trillion dollars in losses. That's it. SVB is imploding over a $15B loss and JP Morgan is rumored to have $47B in unrealized losses on their books. *EDIT: the big 4 banks are at $114B in losses as of this moment with some estimates showing $600B in total unrealized losses across the banking sector* It's not a loss til you sell, right? Consumer credit card debt alone has reached $1 trillion. Most people no longer have adjustable rate mortgages, so we can discount that one, but the commercial mortgage industry isn't so tidy. It was more or less forgotten when regulations were tightened post-2008.

The numbers as of March 1st 2023-

MBS (mortgage backed securities) makes up 2.7 Trillion dollars

Commercial real estate makes up 2.9T

Residential makes up 2.5T

These are just a few, the link above has all the data.

[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRCCLACBS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRCCLACBS) shows that the credit card loan default rate has crept up to 2.25% as of Q4 2022.

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/03/06/auto-loan-delinquencies-up-in-2022/11393399002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/03/06/auto-loan-delinquencies-up-in-2022/11393399002/) \---6% of all subprime auto loans are late on payments.

Oh, and let's not forget inflation is somewhere between 6-8% YoY, and real inflation is as high as 20% solely based on dollars printed and money devalued. AND the M2 money supply is shrinking at a rate synonymous with economic depressions. M2 has only decreased from $21.7T to $21.2T since Feb 2022, representing a $500B drop or 2.3%.

All of this is to say, for the banks to be squeezed to the tune of $2 trillion from all of the above factors isn't much. If you take away the drop in M2 money supply, you're at $1.5T. If you take away an additional 8% from their assets since Feb 2022 due to inflation, you're already in the red ($1.5T-1.76T= -.26T). Now, that might be an exaggeration or conflation of factors. But if you even start to get close to 5-8% default rates on commercial loans (which are going to be hit harder due to a drop in consumer spending)- you wipe out another $150 Billion to $232 Billion. Not to mention what happens if MBS counted as assets on the banks books start to get dumped (again). Technically, if MBS, commercial, and residential properties collectively lose 10-30% of their value, this whole thing starts to get really ugly. This can all get out of hand quickly, especially if there are people who try to pull all of their money out of the banks because as we know, fractional reserve banking means they probably don't have enough to assuage the fears of the public at large.....

Even if the banks don't fully go into the red due to defaults, if they start to get close there's a good chance they'll have to start selling assets and unwinding liabilities to maintain adequate reserves per federal regulation, or risk going down completely. And once that selling starts, you better buckle up because the more of those assets that hit the market from various commercial banks, the less those assets will be worth on the open market due to supply outweighing demand.

We will more than likely end up in a situation where the Fed raises rates, attempting to execute a 'soft landing' but once the dominoes start to fall, it's very difficult to stop rolling defaults. First, consumers default on credit card loans, then home loans and auto loans, then businesses default on loans and fail to pay their leases, REIT's start to get squeezed, banks are unable to recover a large chunk of loaned out money, and all of a sudden you have banks creeping up on default, requiring a bailout from big daddy warbucks, the government. Even assets sold to recuperate borrowed money will become worth less than the loan value itself if there is too much selling at once.

The ideal play here is to be cash heavy once the selling really starts. You could try to time the market and buy some puts, but you might also get royally screwed if the party keeps going for longer than expected. The issue that stocks will find themselves in is that treasuries at 4.5% look very attractive if you're expecting a down year, which as more banks start having problems, people may very well get spooked and sell off their equities to sit in cash or treasuries/money market funds.

I've moved to about 20% cash, piled some into FAZ to short the banks with leverage (not ideal due to decay, I know), and I'm piling up cash in the event that real estate becomes more attractive, because you'd be able to buy at a discount and refinance once this all cools down in 3-5 years as is historically typical. Ultimately I like my stronger stocks like AAPL, GOOG, etc. I've sold over half my NVDA stake after the recent run-up because well, 100% gains in a few months is a little much, don't you think? A good bit of my cash on hand is sitting in a fund gaining 4.5% until I decide to deploy it in the event of a massive cascading selloff.

UPDATE 04/01/2023
-Fed Reserve opened u $2T of backstop liquidity. Not saying I was right about $2T being the magic number, but pretty coincidental considering that's what St. Louis Federal Reserve site data said. 
-SVB now being absorbed by First Citizens bank, curious to see if it backfires, but FC probably believes that the fed will keep stepping in, so much for QT as the feds balance sheet shot up $400B in two weeks to bail out regional banks. 
-Made some quick money on FAZ by selling the day after the fed announced the liquidity backstop. Glad I got out immediately.  
-The next stop on the market crash train ride will be when rates finally peak and come back down- that's historically when the market crashes.

But stuff is just about to kick off and I am going to help explain what is happening and will be happening in the coming weeks and months.

From the start of this fed cycle, I have been wondering who has been eating losses. Basic financial equation 101 teaches you that the present value of an asset is a function of the discount rate applied to its future cf or coupon rate. When the 10/30 year went from 1.5-2.0% in 2019-2021 to 4-5% this year, this meant the market value of those bonds would have fallen by close to 20-25%.

For example TLT, which is the 30 year teasury ETF, has fallen by about 21% in the LTM.

Most people don't understand the bond market in the US is the largest in the world, dwarfing the stock market. It is about twice the size of the stockmarket and is the deepest and most liquid securities market in the world. Within this market, the deepest and most liquid part of the market is made up of US treasuries and mortgage backed agency MBS securities.

With the sudden spike up in rates over the last 12-16 months, the mark to market losses of the bond market is probably somewhere to the tune of 4-6 trillion. And I have always been wondering where that was going to show up and blow something up in the financial market. And the answer is in the banks.

Don't believe what they tell you, Silicon Valley Bank was a very conservative bank. Out of their \~200 billion in assets, very little (&lt;0.5%) was venture debt lending. As you can see in their Q4 Balance Sheet, they had 15 billion in cash/cash like securities, about 120 billion investment securities and 70 billion in loans.

https://preview.redd.it/1txj1mjma1na1.png?width=523&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5db030273760e55e735cbe23f59f7bdc234c4ba6

within that 120 billion investment securities, it is almost entirely treasuries and Agency MBS/CMO and CMBS with a touch of muni bonds. You can't build a more conservative book if you tried. As these are all effective government securities as the GSEs are still in conservatorship under the treasury. For years due to Basel III, US banks have been derisking and now most of their balance sheets consists of government or quasi government securites which have almost no default risks.

https://preview.redd.it/lsa5410ab1na1.png?width=1383&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=08f812017cc1f95d3bb9744f7d63a150d9af5980

Now looking at the loan book, you can see the bulk of it is in global fund banking and investor dependent. Global Fund banking is an extremely safe segment, it consists of largely funding or bridging loans to venture capitalist making transactions. So for example if a VC  wants to invest in company A, but they want to wait 2 months before drawing down from their LPs, they will go to SVB to get a credit line for this purpose. This is an extremely safe business model as Venture/PE Funding is contracted funding and there has been basically no defaults on these types of loans ever in history. Then you have private bank, which consisted of lending to rich people over collateralized through the value of their houses, which is also a pretty safe business model as their asset coverage typically exceeds 150% of the loan value.

Even the investor dependent segment is typically very safe book, as they will write loans as simply a bridge when a financing round for the company has already closed, but are still waiting a few months for the all the papers to be signed and the funds to be transfered.

https://preview.redd.it/r44w54mdc1na1.png?width=1382&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=398e0e9c28ff1ac7136629523f3d6097a2a899c6

So wtf is happening, this is a bank that is holding like 2/3 of its book in government papers and the rest in fairly safe lending. The speculative lending to early tech business represent &lt;0.5% of the book.

The answer is the federal reserve, this guy

https://preview.redd.it/55mo4dswd1na1.png?width=275&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d709bd4f520d27a18147429f343a3a24ce45dcb3

He basically fucked over the entire banking sector. Remember that 120 billion in agency backed papers  and treasuries in the investment securities section of SVB , well, most of that is HTM (Hold to Maturnity). Its a bank, get over it, a duration mismatch is expected. But the amplitute of the loss is proportional to the raise in rates due simply how bonds work. In the SVB book, the average maturity is around 6 years. Some simple math point to about a 10% loss in this investment book that hasn't been marked to market, representing about 12 billion in losses. This wiped out all the equity of the bank and some of the  value of the bonds.

Overall the Agency papers and treasuries can be sold over the course of the next couple of weeks and depositers will get about 60 cents on the dollar and the remainder will be sold over the next 12-48 months and I expect most depositers to get back close to 90 cents + on the dollar.

Well that's great, you might say. NO, IT IS NOT GREAT. BECAUSE SVB was not a bad bank, it was actually a pretty conservative bank. It also wouldn't be insolvent if it wasn't for the fed. What it did suffer from was a unique deposit base that was largely not FDIC insured. Since it was largely catering to start-up companies, most accounts went above the FDIC limit of 250k, as a result, this was simply a bank run similar to during the great depression. It doesn't matter how safe the bank was, if there is a run, you won't survive it. And the uniqueness of start-ups which are most often cash burning and therefore extremely senstivie to the lack of cash just meant they were more flighty depositers. Marry that to the game theory dynamics of the low cost of getting your money out first so you can meet payroll mean't that once it starts, you can't stop it.

Ok, you ask, what the hell does it all mean for the future. Well, here is the thing. If SVB is underwater, are all the banks are underwater?

Here are the assets of JPM, again, for the major banks, JPM has a 3.5 trillion balance sheet, and BOA has a 3 trillion balance sheet. JPM only lists out 641 billion of that 3.5 trillion as trading securities and thus and they reported a loss of \~50 billion or \~8%.

https://preview.redd.it/pskuutvch1na1.png?width=1631&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b2440e41969af319d6b7c38f0ad887e9684533d7

This is a similar picture with BOA, which lists out trading securites of 300 billion, but there is another 2.7 billion in other assets, of which 1 trillion are longer dated treasuries and agency securities. If we mark to market those losses, there is another 80-100 billion in losses which are not being marked to market.

https://preview.redd.it/gwn7vmluk1na1.png?width=1775&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9aff904456f63c469680d9b96f45cf06327e4dae

Again, going back to the original thought, someone lost 4-6 trillion through the bond market from fed raising rates. Close to 2 trillion is lost through agency securities with the reminder from treasuries. Unironically, close to 15% of this is lost from the fed itself, due to its own balance sheet of treasuries and agency papers. It looks like around 30% of those agency security losses or about \~600 billion is through the commerical banks. I suspect probably another 300-400 billion though treasuries. So the banking sector has lost about 1 trillion in the past year, of which only maybe 100-200 billion has actually been marked-to-market down as losses.

Remember, the size of the losses in Subprime was only about \~100 billion. Now, every 50 bps increase by the fed results in close to that much in losses to the banking sector. So yes, Mr. Powell wil likely blow up the entire banking system.

https://preview.redd.it/rc3npwezm1na1.png?width=1196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b129ee19c69c5e14ef3be6410b3c5da580c943c2

Edit 1: Alot of people are pointing out that the deposit base of other banks are signficantly different. Yes 100% agree, but the run on liquidity of a bank can come in two ways. One is on the deposit side (see great depression and SVB), the other way is through the interbank funding market (alas 2008). I will write a part II in the coming days of the drying up of that source of liqudity.

Edit 2: Also a lot of people keep pointing to hedging and managing duration risk. This is BS as all the banks have this unrealized loss on their balance sheet, go look.Imagine God telling everyone he is going to destroy your house, now go and try to find insurance on your house for less than the cost of building a new house. And to the smart asses mentioning swaps. Go ahead and try to swap your house for a new house for anything less 0. Now think termites slowly destroying your house over the course of a year instead an earthquake, good luck being the person trying to hedge that. But the most relevant point is that a security that is classified under the HTM category, it cannot have any hedges. So to all the people who think this was a risk management issue, go look at all the other banks, they have not hedged their HTM securties either. To compound this, the fed in 2021 signaled very strongly to market that rates were going to held at zero until 2024, and then pivoted in 12 months, throwing everyone in for a loop. There was no realistic way for any management or risk management team to have handled this. So yes, the blame lies largely with the fed here.

Edit 3: on all the people saying the larger banks are so much smarter and know what they are doing. SVB had the most liquid portfolio of any bank out there. They had about 8% of their desposits in cash and about \~45% in GSE/treasuries which is the most liquid instrument out there and can be sold down in a weeks notice. None of the other/largest banks are even close to that. The larger banks have a much lower deposit base like \~25%-30% of their capital base and maybe 10-20% in equity and 50-60% are based in interbank financing (hello 2008). The finiky parts of the larger bank's capital structure aren't deposits, most of these are FDIC insured (but still probably only half or so as the business accounts certaintly aren't), it is the intrabank financing part. You know, the stuff that blew up lehman and bear sterns.

Also people don't seem grasp what a bank is and think they should be 100% in cash or something. You do understand banks make money from spreads. Signaling to investors you are taking depositer cash, and investing them in 3-month t-bills yielding 0.25% is a great way to tell them you don't actually have a business model and is a money losing startup like Wework or some shit.",2200,1002,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11obkuc/why_svb_is_just_the_beginning_analysis_of_the/,"Why SVB is just the beginning, Analysis of the fall of SVB from a Financial Analyst Ignore the headlines and news anchor, they don't really understand shit. But stuff is just about to kick off and I am going to help explain what is happening and will be happening in the coming weeks and months.

From the start of this fed cycle, I have been wondering who has been eating losses. Basic financial equation 101 teaches you that the present value of an asset is a function of the discount rate applied to its future cf or coupon rate. When the 10/30 year went from 1.5-2.0% in 2019-2021 to 4-5% this year, this meant the market value of those bonds would have fallen by close to 20-25%.

For example TLT, which is the 30 year teasury ETF, has fallen by about 21% in the LTM.

Most people don't understand the bond market in the US is the largest in the world, dwarfing the stock market. It is about twice the size of the stockmarket and is the deepest and most liquid securities market in the world. Within this market, the deepest and most liquid part of the market is made up of US treasuries and mortgage backed agency MBS securities.

11of661,2023-03-11 08:48:42,stocks,shortyafter,"SIVB - a discussion of similarities to the Global Financial Crisis, and what it means for stocks.","As much as I hate to see it, I love to see it.  Because this is the same thing that happened in 2008.  Obviously there are differences yeah, the banks aren't holding so much junk, they're better capitalized, etc. etc . But let's take a look at some similarities:

1. Things started cracking prior to the '08 crisis during a hiking cycle.  The teaser rate mortgages adjusted up and investors took a lot of losses on subprime MBS.  House prices went down making the situation even worse.
2. We're actually very close to the federal funds highs of 2005-2007 (5.25%) - [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS)
3. This was all preceded by an easing cycle, which had encouraged investors and institutions to use leverage in order to up their returns.  Bad loans were made, also, since servicing and refinancing them was easy.  Liquidity was ample.  There was bubble behavior: real estate.  Today: digital coins, meme stocks, etc. 
4. Hiking was going on in order to combat inflation.  It was not optional.
5. There was a sense that ""real estate always goes up"", leading to bad bets there, and subsequent losses.  The same could be said for the stock market today (Archegos), or the notion that treasuries are a safe asset (they are, but they can still lose value).
6. 2008 was a crisis of panic.  The market could not determine who was swimming naked, liquidity dried up.  Today there is growing concern of not only who is exposed to SIVB, but to a larger extent who is exposed to interest rate risk.

Look, I ain't saying ""THIS IS IT BOYS"", because I don't know.  I'm not a doomer.  But economies and financial markets are *complex adaptive systems*, and they have tipping points.  Think of it like Jurassic Park.  Yeah, it seems like everything is under control, but an engineer decides to go rogue, cut the power, and all hell breaks loose.  You can't control everything.  You couldn't have predicted this.  One small event can lead to a cascade that brings the whole thing down.  For a real life example, 2008 is one of them, as is the First World War (the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand).

What is the lesson then?  Be prepared.  It was irresponsible to be running rates that low for so long and then hiking massively afterwards.  If the economy was to be stimulated, there are better options, like fiscal policy or directing QE towards productive industries.  Unfortunately, this is the framework the Fed and central banks have adopted, and there's an argument to be made that all we have succeeded in doing with these policies is to pump asset prices and create distortions in markets.

Finally, this is /r/stocks, so as far as stocks go, I'm not saying to pull your money out.  I'm saying to be aware of what's going on right now, and to take that into consideration next time to you decide to buy an asset.  As long as things are going smoothly, stocks will continue their eternal march upward, thus negating the need to look at valuation or margin of safety.  However, if we do reach one of these ""tipping points"", there's a very real risk that things will start to come down and stay down.  You do not want to be caught with your pants down.  Do note, also, that modern investors are used the Fed sweeping in to save them.  With inflation looking the way it is, that may not be as guaranteed as it once was, and certainly not as welcome at a time when we need to get prices down.  Anyway, this is just my 2 cents and not expert advice.

For a more academic discussion, I encourage you to read William White's article from the BIS in 2006, ""Is price stability enough?"" Mr. White predicted that prolonged easing would lead to the predicament that we are seeing now:

*""This implies a delicate balancing act for the monetary authorities, in which tightening must be slow enough to avoid destabilising financial markets, but fast enough not to destabilise inflationary expectations. ""*

[https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/10/29/business/south-korea-economic-trauma/](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/10/29/business/south-korea-economic-trauma/)",50,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11of661/sivb_a_discussion_of_similarities_to_the_global/,"SIVB - a discussion of similarities to the Global Financial Crisis, and what it means for stocks. As much as I hate to see it, I love to see it.  Because this is the same thing that happened in 2008.  Obviously there are differences yeah, the banks aren't holding so much junk, they're better capitalized, etc. etc . But let's take a look at some similarities:

1. Things started cracking prior to the '08 crisis during a hiking cycle.  The teaser rate mortgages adjusted up and investors took a lot of losses on subprime MBS.  House prices went down making the situation even worse.
2. We're actually very close to the federal funds highs of 2005-2007 (5.25%) - [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS)
3. This was all preceded by an easing cycle, which had encouraged investors and institutions to use leverage in order to up their returns.  Bad loans were made, also, since servicing and refinancing them was easy.  Liquidity was ample.  There was bubble behavior: real estate.  Today: digital coins, meme stocks, etc. 
4. Hiking was going on in order to combat inflation.  It was not optional.
5. There was a sense that ""real estate always goes up"", leading to bad bets there, and subsequent losses.  The same could be said for the stock market today (Archegos), or the notion that treasuries are a safe asset (they are, but they can still lose value).
6. 2008 was a crisis of panic.  The market could not determine who was swimming naked, liquidity dried up.  Today there is growing concern of not only who is exposed to SIVB, but to a larger extent who is exposed to interest rate risk.

Look, I ain't saying ""THIS IS IT BOYS"", because I don't know.  I'm not a doomer.  But economies and financial markets are *complex adaptive systems*, and they have tipping points.  Think of it like Jurassic Park.  Yeah, it seems like everything is under control, but an engineer decides to go rogue, cut the power, and all hell breaks loose.  You can't control everything.  You couldn't have predicted this.  One small event can lead to a cascade that brings the whole thing down.  For a real life example, 2008 is one of them, as is the First World War (the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand).

What is the lesson then?  Be prepared.  It was irresponsible to be running rates that low for so long and then hiking massively afterwards.  If the economy was to be stimulated, there are better options, like fiscal policy or directing QE towards productive industries.  Unfortunately, this is the framework the Fed and central banks have adopted, and there's an argument to be made that all we have succeeded in doing with these policies is to pump asset prices and create distortions in markets.

Finally, this is /r/stocks, so as far as stocks go, I'm not saying to pull your money out.  I'm saying to be aware of what's going on right now, and to take that into consideration next time to you decide to buy an asset.  As long as things are going smoothly, stocks will continue their eternal march upward, thus negating the need to look at valuation or margin of safety.  However, if we do reach one of these ""tipping points"", there's a very real risk that things will start to come down and stay down.  You do not want to be caught with your pants down.  Do note, also, that modern investors are used the Fed sweeping in to save them.  With inflation looking the way it is, that may not be as guaranteed as it once was, and certainly not as welcome at a time when we need to get prices down.  Anyway, this is just my 2 cents and not expert advice.

Good luck to all.

Banks usually hold US Treasuries as a form of pristine collateral. With the great inflow of money during the pandemic, the volume has greatly increased especially in long term bonds. 

With rising interest rates the value of these bonds has decreased. According to US-Accounting rules the value of these bonds does not have to revalued in the balance sheet, since they asssume to just hold the bond until maturity. But in case of unexpected events (like silvergate and silicon valley bank), they need to realize the losses by selling prematurely. 

Usually the banks are hedged for this kind of risk. But the risk can not be eliminated, it can just be shifted to another entity. As far as I understand with interest rate swaps. 

Yesterday resulted in the biggest selloff of 2 year US-Treasuries since 1989. Forced deleveraging could lead to further ""run to the exit"" situation, which lead to higher rates which increases the problem even further.

I'm wondering right now, who are the counterparties for these swaps? How are derivatives called and how can I find out, which entity has a big exposure to it?

I would like to short these positions, since I belive that such a large volume can not properly managed and can likley lead to a systemic crisis.",11,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11ofkrq/ustreasury_interest_rate_swaps_counter_party_risk/,"US-Treasury Interest Rate Swaps Counter Party Risk: Reason for next GFC?

You know it, I know it, we all know it. Inverse Cramer works because being wrong on the overt advice helps hide the collusion.

So the trick is, what's he really saying?

JP Morgan and fortress. As some have already pointed out, ""what else is a fortress? A Citadel.""

So that's our starting point. Let's look at major news involving the two...

Citadel poaches Python developer from JP Morgan
https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/2021/11/quant-jobs-at-citadel

&gt;McGuire spent the past eighteen and a half years at JPMorgan, where he was most recently an executive director in quantitative research on the bank's Athena team. Athena is JPMorgan's risk and pricing engine, which is coded in Python. At Citadel, McGuire will be a quantitative software engineer, based in New York City.

&gt;Recruiters say the big demand now is for quants who are Python experts - hedge funds like Citadel need Python developes to work on software that can back test trading strategies. 

So Citadel picks up this guy to backtest new trade strategies end of 2021. This year, in a month's time, will be the end of the Bull Run as the market slides into bear territory.

Who gets obliterated through 2022? Just about every IPO since 2020.

See, Citadel came to prominence over HFT and trade confirmation technology. They DEFINITELY do NOT take advantage of PFOF to front run customers through any trading apps.

Let's take a peek at one of those trading apps, just a random one
https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/23/03/g31306072/shareholder-alert-pomerantz-law-firm-investigates-claims-on-behalf-of-investors-of-robinhood-marke

Timely news....

So here's my belief. Citadel gets reamed on their trades early 2021 by retail surge. They have to bail out their own - Plotkin and such. They're pissed and want to make up their balance sheet and then some. They poach this guy to develop a more aggressive strategy, perhaps tapping deeper into contract premiums and ""hedging"" those contracts with traditional stocks - bought and sold - in no particular order, mind you - adhering to T+2.

I bet it works GREAT. Revenue pours in and Citadel makes something like 18 billion in profit through the very bearish 2022. Tons generated from retail-bought options on startups, and everything else, that fall flat through the year.

Oops, maybe a little too aggressive? They back off beginning of 2023, market downward pressure relaxes for a bit of a bump...except now every one in entities that invest heavily in start ups, many from Silicon Valley, are nuked. Those fronting the actual cash start pulling their money out.

There's also something about JP Morgan, Citadel, and automated Repo confirmation with MaketAxxess, but I'm a dummy.

The Funding and Liquidity score of 'a' has been assigned below the 'aa' category implied score due to the following adjustment reason: Non-deposit funding (negative) and deposit structure (negative).
Fitch Affirms Charles Schwab at 'A'/'F1'; Outlook Stable
Fri 03 Feb, 2023 - 1:58 PM ET

Fitch Ratings - Chicago - 03 Feb 2023: Fitch Ratings has affirmed The Charles Schwab Corporation's (Schwab) Long- and Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'A'/'F1', and its Viability Rating (VR) at 'a'. At the same time, Fitch has affirmed Charles Schwab Bank, SSB's (CSB) Long-Term and Short-Term IDRs at 'A+'/'F1' and its VR at 'a'. The Rating Outlooks are Stable.


KEY RATING DRIVERS
Business Profile Supports High Rating: The ratings affirmation reflects Schwab's strong franchise in the mass market retail investor space and within the asset/wealth management space, its strong operating performance, strong benchmark capital levels, and its solid funding and liquidity profile.


Ratings Constrained by Operational Risks, Market Risk: Over the near-to-medium term, Schwab's ratings are constrained by the idiosyncratic operational and reputational risks associated with the ongoing integration of Ameritrade. Management has indicated that cost saves and revenue synergies are in line with expectations to date. Longer term, Fitch believes the primary rating constraint is the high sensitivity of revenue and earnings to volatility in equity markets and interest rates.


Performance Benefitting from Higher Rates: Schwab's revenue and pre-tax income continued to climb throughout 2022, benefitting from higher short-term interest rates that drove a meaningful increase in spread revenue, continued organic growth of net new assets and strong client engagement. While these tailwinds have been modestly offset by weak stock market performance, which drives asset management/administration fees, Schwab has shown the ability to control expense levels, which has led to the firm consistently generating positive operating leverage.

Fitch expects rates to move even higher over the next year, which should further benefit Schwab's spread and profitability, but metrics are expected to remain consistent with the current rating.


Benchmark Capital Ratio Remains Strong: Schwab maintains solid benchmark capital levels, with a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 21.2% at 3Q22. The firm's regulatory binding constraint is its Tier 1 Leverage ratio, which was estimated at 7.2% at 4Q22; up 100 bps from a year ago driven by strong earnings and a decline in assets given the movement of customer deposits from the balance sheet to higher rate products. During 3Q22, Schwab lowered its operating objective for its Tier 1 Leverage Ratio by 25 bps, to 6.50%-6.75%. Fitch considers these operating levels to be reasonable relative to the VR.

Tangible Capital Affected by Securities Mark-to-Market: While benchmark and regulatory capital levels remain strong, Fitch also notes that Schwab's tangible common equity (TCE) levels have been meaningfully and negatively affected by the impact of higher rates on the investment portfolio.

Schwab's TCE to tangible asset ratio was 1.1%% at 3Q22, well below rated peers. After quarter-end 3Q22, management moved $80 billion of available-for-sale securities to held-to-maturity (HTM) and indicated that the company would only be at risk of going to a negative TCE with a several hundred basis point instantaneous increase in medium-term rates from current levels. Fitch expects Schwab's TCE to improve from this relatively low level during 2023 as earnings support further tangible capital growth and longer-term rates moderate.


Funding and Liquidity Supportive of Rating: Fitch views Schwab's funding diversity and available liquidity as solid. While Schwab's deposit balances, which are the primary source of funding for its three bank subsidiaries, declined during 2022 primarily due to client cash sorting resulting from the rising interest rate environment, Fitch notes that the firm's overall deposit franchise remains relatively strong and near-term liquidity is sufficient to handle further deposit run-off that is expected as clients find alternatives to holding cash on Schwab's balance sheet.

At 3Q22, Schwab's liquidity coverage ratio was a robust 118% and it, along with its operating subsidiaries, had access to $95 billion of liquidity from the Federal Home Loan Bank, the Fed Discount Window, unsecured lines of credit with various external banks and an unsecured commercial paper program. Fitch expects Schwab to utilize these non-deposit funding sources throughout 2023 to manage deposit outflows as clients continue to make cash allocation decisions.

Short-Term Rating Driven by Funding and Liquidity Score: Schwab's short-term IDR of 'F1' reflects strong intrinsic capacity for timely payment of short-term financial commitments. While Schwab's VR of 'a' corresponds with an 'F1+' or 'F1' Short-Term IDR under Fitch's Global Bank criteria, the 'F1' short-term rating is assigned because Schwab's funding and liquidity score of 'a' is below the 'aa-' minimum threshold required for an 'F1+' short-term rating.


Stable Outlook Reflects Operating Performance, Capital Management: The Stable Rating Outlook reflects the expectation for stable to improving operating performance driven by higher rates, continued net new asset growth and synergies from the Ameritrade acquisition. Further, the Stable Rating Outlook assumes Schwab will continue to enjoy stable liquidity levels and maintain strong risk-based and leverage capitalization.


Holding Company VR Equalized with Operating Bank: CSB's and Schwab's VR are equalized, reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and subsidiary failure and default probabilities. Further, while Schwab's common equity double leverage is expected to remain well above 120%, Fitch considers holding company liquidity to be strong, supporting the VR equalization. Bank holding companies are mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of strength for their bank subsidiaries.


RATING SENSITIVITIES
Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:
Operational Issues Could Pressure Ratings: Schwab's ratings remain sensitive to a large operational or technological security loss specific to the firm that causes significant reputational damage. Operational and technological security losses are inherently difficult to predict and measure and do serve as an upwards rating constraint. As noted above, Fitch believes this risk is exacerbated in the near term with the integration of Ameritrade as it completes numerous platform conversions through 2023 and 2024, particularly if the market experiences a prolonged period of volatility.

Higher Credit or Market Risk Appetite May Lead to Downgrade: Should the company loosen underwriting standards within its core loan portfolio or take on more notable risk within its investment portfolio, such that it meaningfully increases the credit or interest rate risk profile of the balance sheet and ultimately affects operating performance, it would be viewed negatively from a ratings perspective.

Sensitive to Capital Management: A sustained decline in Schwab banks' Tier 1 leverage ratio below the 5% regulatory threshold for well-capitalized banks or reporting negative TCE could also drive negative rating momentum along with reporting an LCR below regulatory requirements, though Fitch believes this is a low likelihood event.

Holding Company Sensitive to Liquidity Management: Should Schwab's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate trouble accessing the capital markets, or should liquidity coverage, as measured by cash plus high-quality liquid securities fall below four quarters of required cash outlays, Fitch could notch down the holding company VR from that of CSB.


Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:
Stronger Revenue Diversity and Capital Management Could Lift Rating: Over the longer term, Schwab's VR and IDR could see upside of potentially one notch should it generate greater revenue stability and diversity through various market cycles, combined with sustained capital and liquidity levels above internal targets. To the extent Schwab is also able to effectively execute its acquisition of Ameritrade with minimal integration challenges and client attrition and meet or exceed its projected financial synergies, it could also result in positive ratings momentum. This would also be predicated on the firm maintaining a conservative stance in relation to credit risk.

Short-Term Rating: The Short-Term IDR is directly linked to the Long-Term IDR and would be expected to move in tandem. The Short-Term IDRs are also sensitive to Schwab's funding and liquidity factor score.


OTHER DEBT AND ISSUER RATINGS: KEY RATING DRIVERS
Long-Term and Short-Term Senior Unsecured: In accordance with the Bank Rating Criteria, Fitch has equalized Schwab's long-term senior unsecured debt rating with its Long-Term IDR, which is also equalized with its VR. This is the case when Fitch observes or expects the sum of holding company senior debt and group junior debt (QJD) to clearly and sustainably exceed 10% of risk-weighted assets (RWA) for the group. At 3Q22, Fitch estimates Schwab's levels of holding company senior debt and group QJD to be over 20% of RWAs. Schwab's short-term senior unsecured rating maps to its 'F1' Short-Term IDR, which drives the rating on the firm's CP program.

Preferred Stock: Preferred stock issued by Schwab is notched down from the holding company rating in accordance with Fitch's assessment of the instrument's non-performance and relative loss severity risk profiles. Schwab's preferred stock issuances are notched four notches from the IDR, which includes two notches for non-performance and two notches for loss absorbing capacity.

Long-Term and Short-Term Deposits: CSB's long-term deposits are rated one notch higher than its IDR because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities superior recovery prospects in the event of default. CSB's short-term deposits are rated 'F1+' in accordance with Fitch's Bank Rating Criteria based on the bank's long-term deposit rating and Fitch's assessment of the firm's funding and liquidity profile.

Government Support Rating: Schwab has a GSR of 'ns'. In Fitch's view, the probability of government support is unlikely and IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.


OTHER DEBT AND ISSUER RATINGS: RATING SENSITIVITIES
Long-Term and Short-Term Senior Unsecured: The senior unsecured debt rating is directly linked to Schwab's VR and Long-Term IDR and would be expected to move in tandem. Additionally, if Fitch were to observe or expect the sum of holding company senior debt and group junior debt (QJD) to clearly and sustainably trend below 10% of RWA for the group, the firm's Long-Term IDR and long-term senior unsecured rating could be downgraded.

Preferred Stock: The preferred stock ratings are directly linked to Schwab's VR and would be expected to move in tandem with any changes in Schwab's credit profile.

Long-Term and Short-Term Deposits: CSB's long- and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change in the entity's Long-Term and Short-Term IDRs as well as Fitch's view of its fundamental funding and liquidity profile.

Government Support Rating: Schwab's GSR would be sensitive to any change in Fitch's view of U.S. sovereign support, which Fitch views as unlikely.


SUBSIDIARIES &amp; AFFILIATES: KEY RATING DRIVERS
Bank Subsidiary Rating Receives IDR Uplift: CSB's Long-Term IDR is notched up from the bank's VR. Under Fitch's Bank Rating Criteria, bank-level Long-Term IDRs receive uplift if the sum of holding company senior debt and group qualifying junior debt (QJD) is expected to be sustained above 10% of RWA for the group. Fitch expects that Schwab's QJD levels will remain above 10% over the long term.

CSB's 'F1' Short-Term IDR reflects strong intrinsic capacity for timely payment of short-term financial commitments. While the firm's 'a' VR also corresponds with an 'F1+' Short-Term IDR under Fitch's Global Bank criteria, the 'F1' short-term rating is assigned because its funding and liquidity score of 'a' is below the 'aa-' minimum threshold needed for an 'F1+' short-term rating.

Bank Subsidiary Sensitivity: If Fitch were to observe or expect the sum of holding company senior debt and group junior debt (QJD) to clearly and sustainably trend below 10% of RWA for the group, CSB's Long-Term IDR could be downgraded and equalized with its VR.


VR ADJUSTMENTS
The Asset Quality score of 'a' has been assigned below the 'aa' category implied score due to the following adjustment reason: Concentrations (negative), Non-loan exposures (negative) and historical and future metric (negative).

The Earnings Profitability score of 'a+' has been assigned below the 'aa' category implied score due to the following adjustment reason: Revenue diversity (negative).

The Capitalization and Leverage score of 'a+' has been assigned below the 'aa' category implied score due to the following adjustment reason: Leverage and risk-weight calculation (negative).

The Funding and Liquidity score of 'a' has been assigned below the 'aa' category implied score due to the following adjustment reason: Non-deposit funding (negative) and deposit structure (negative).

Fitch Affirms Charles Schwab at 'A'/'F1'; Outlook Stable
Fri 03 Feb, 2023 - 1:58 PM ET

Fitch Ratings - Chicago - 03 Feb 2023: Fitch Ratings has affirmed The Charles Schwab Corporation's (Schwab) Long- and Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'A'/'F1', and its Viability Rating (VR) at 'a'. At the same time, Fitch has affirmed Charles Schwab Bank, SSB's (CSB) Long-Term and Short-Term IDRs at 'A+'/'F1' and its VR at 'a'. The Rating Outlooks are Stable.


KEY RATING DRIVERS
Business Profile Supports High Rating: The ratings affirmation reflects Schwab's strong franchise in the mass market retail investor space and within the asset/wealth management space, its strong operating performance, strong benchmark capital levels, and its solid funding and liquidity profile.


Ratings Constrained by Operational Risks, Market Risk: Over the near-to-medium term, Schwab's ratings are constrained by the idiosyncratic operational and reputational risks associated with the ongoing integration of Ameritrade. Management has indicated that cost saves and revenue synergies are in line with expectations to date. Longer term, Fitch believes the primary rating constraint is the high sensitivity of revenue and earnings to volatility in equity markets and interest rates.


Performance Benefitting from Higher Rates: Schwab's revenue and pre-tax income continued to climb throughout 2022, benefitting from higher short-term interest rates that drove a meaningful increase in spread revenue, continued organic growth of net new assets and strong client engagement. While these tailwinds have been modestly offset by weak stock market performance, which drives asset management/administration fees, Schwab has shown the ability to control expense levels, which has led to the firm consistently generating positive operating leverage.

Fitch expects rates to move even higher over the next year, which should further benefit Schwab's spread and profitability, but metrics are expected to remain consistent with the current rating.


Benchmark Capital Ratio Remains Strong: Schwab maintains solid benchmark capital levels, with a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 21.2% at 3Q22. The firm's regulatory binding constraint is its Tier 1 Leverage ratio, which was estimated at 7.2% at 4Q22; up 100 bps from a year ago driven by strong earnings and a decline in assets given the movement of customer deposits from the balance sheet to higher rate products. During 3Q22, Schwab lowered its operating objective for its Tier 1 Leverage Ratio by 25 bps, to 6.50%-6.75%. Fitch considers these operating levels to be reasonable relative to the VR.

Tangible Capital Affected by Securities Mark-to-Market: While benchmark and regulatory capital levels remain strong, Fitch also notes that Schwab's tangible common equity (TCE) levels have been meaningfully and negatively affected by the impact of higher rates on the investment portfolio.

Schwab's TCE to tangible asset ratio was 1.1%% at 3Q22, well below rated peers. After quarter-end 3Q22, management moved $80 billion of available-for-sale securities to held-to-maturity (HTM) and indicated that the company would only be at risk of going to a negative TCE with a several hundred basis point instantaneous increase in medium-term rates from current levels. Fitch expects Schwab's TCE to improve from this relatively low level during 2023 as earnings support further tangible capital growth and longer-term rates moderate.


Funding and Liquidity Supportive of Rating: Fitch views Schwab's funding diversity and available liquidity as solid. While Schwab's deposit balances, which are the primary source of funding for its three bank subsidiaries, declined during 2022 primarily due to client cash sorting resulting from the rising interest rate environment, Fitch notes that the firm's overall deposit franchise remains relatively strong and near-term liquidity is sufficient to handle further deposit run-off that is expected as clients find alternatives to holding cash on Schwab's balance sheet.

At 3Q22, Schwab's liquidity coverage ratio was a robust 118% and it, along with its operating subsidiaries, had access to $95 billion of liquidity from the Federal Home Loan Bank, the Fed Discount Window, unsecured lines of credit with various external banks and an unsecured commercial paper program. Fitch expects Schwab to utilize these non-deposit funding sources throughout 2023 to manage deposit outflows as clients continue to make cash allocation decisions.

Short-Term Rating Driven by Funding and Liquidity Score: Schwab's short-term IDR of 'F1' reflects strong intrinsic capacity for timely payment of short-term financial commitments. While Schwab's VR of 'a' corresponds with an 'F1+' or 'F1' Short-Term IDR under Fitch's Global Bank criteria, the 'F1' short-term rating is assigned because Schwab's funding and liquidity score of 'a' is below the 'aa-' minimum threshold required for an 'F1+' short-term rating.


Stable Outlook Reflects Operating Performance, Capital Management: The Stable Rating Outlook reflects the expectation for stable to improving operating performance driven by higher rates, continued net new asset growth and synergies from the Ameritrade acquisition. Further, the Stable Rating Outlook assumes Schwab will continue to enjoy stable liquidity levels and maintain strong risk-based and leverage capitalization.


Holding Company VR Equalized with Operating Bank: CSB's and Schwab's VR are equalized, reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and subsidiary failure and default probabilities. Further, while Schwab's common equity double leverage is expected to remain well above 120%, Fitch considers holding company liquidity to be strong, supporting the VR equalization. Bank holding companies are mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of strength for their bank subsidiaries.


RATING SENSITIVITIES
Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:
Operational Issues Could Pressure Ratings: Schwab's ratings remain sensitive to a large operational or technological security loss specific to the firm that causes significant reputational damage. Operational and technological security losses are inherently difficult to predict and measure and do serve as an upwards rating constraint. As noted above, Fitch believes this risk is exacerbated in the near term with the integration of Ameritrade as it completes numerous platform conversions through 2023 and 2024, particularly if the market experiences a prolonged period of volatility.

Higher Credit or Market Risk Appetite May Lead to Downgrade: Should the company loosen underwriting standards within its core loan portfolio or take on more notable risk within its investment portfolio, such that it meaningfully increases the credit or interest rate risk profile of the balance sheet and ultimately affects operating performance, it would be viewed negatively from a ratings perspective.

Sensitive to Capital Management: A sustained decline in Schwab banks' Tier 1 leverage ratio below the 5% regulatory threshold for well-capitalized banks or reporting negative TCE could also drive negative rating momentum along with reporting an LCR below regulatory requirements, though Fitch believes this is a low likelihood event.

Holding Company Sensitive to Liquidity Management: Should Schwab's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate trouble accessing the capital markets, or should liquidity coverage, as measured by cash plus high-quality liquid securities fall below four quarters of required cash outlays, Fitch could notch down the holding company VR from that of CSB.


Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:
Stronger Revenue Diversity and Capital Management Could Lift Rating: Over the longer term, Schwab's VR and IDR could see upside of potentially one notch should it generate greater revenue stability and diversity through various market cycles, combined with sustained capital and liquidity levels above internal targets. To the extent Schwab is also able to effectively execute its acquisition of Ameritrade with minimal integration challenges and client attrition and meet or exceed its projected financial synergies, it could also result in positive ratings momentum. This would also be predicated on the firm maintaining a conservative stance in relation to credit risk.

Short-Term Rating: The Short-Term IDR is directly linked to the Long-Term IDR and would be expected to move in tandem. The Short-Term IDRs are also sensitive to Schwab's funding and liquidity factor score.

As of Saturday afternoon in San Francisco, about 125 venture firms including Sequoia Capital had signed on to the statement, spearheaded by venture firm General Catalyst, according to a person familiar with the matter. First released Friday by a smaller group of signatories, the statement called the events of the last two days “deeply disappointing and concerning,” and said that the investors would continue relationships with the institution if it were bought by another entity.

Also on Saturday, the startup incubator Y Combinator posted a petition signed by hundreds of founders and chief executives to US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and other regulators, asking for “relief and attention to an immediate critical impact on small businesses, startups, and their employees who are depositors at the bank.” The petition asked for small businesses that had deposited funds at Silicon Valley Bank to be made whole, and for Congress to “restore stronger regulatory oversight and capital requirements for regional banks.”

On Friday, a group of investors for high-profile firms met over Zoom in a series of meetings, according to one person familiar with the discussions. General Catalyst Chief Executive Officer Hemant Taneja posted the resulting statement on Twitter following the meetings, indicating the support of Kleiner Perkins, Khosla Ventures and others. In the hours that followed more than 100 other firms signed on, including Sequoia, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions were private. 

“Silicon Valley Bank has been a trusted and long-time partner to the venture capital industry and our founders,” the statement reads. “For forty years, it has been an important platform that played a pivotal role in serving the startup community and supporting the innovation economy in the US.”

General Catalyst’s Taneja told Bloomberg that it was important for tech leaders to communicate and agree on a “consistent approach that we hope can maintain business continuity for our companies.” He added: “Everyone understands that we have a role to play in trying to calm the situation.”

11p4ghc,2023-03-12 03:51:38,stocks,Hanzoisbad,Silicon Valley Bank Collapse Explained in under 400 words.,"# Introduction:

Silicon Valley Bank(SVB) is a bank that primarily serves Venture Capital/Private Equity firms in areas such as Technology and Medical start ups.

&amp;#x200B;

# Reasons:

**Interest rates environment**

In 2021, SVB received a substantial amount of deposit due to overall economy booming. It bought a lot of government treasury bonds at a low interest rate. ([Source](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bond-losses-push-silicon-valley-bank-parent-to-raise-capital-125e89d4?mod=Searchresults_pos2&amp;page=1)) Government bonds are not bad but they are exposed to interest rate risk.  
However, as the FEDs started raising interest rates it reduced the value of bonds SVB had outstanding. When FEDs raise interest rates, this leads to higher coupon rates on newer bonds so older bonds are sold off to capitalize on the higher coupon rates, which in turn reduces the price of older bonds i.e. their value.   


IF a firm had held these bonds till maturity, no losses are made. However, due to poor environment it led to lower investment into VCs so more VCs pulled their deposits out. SVB had very little liquidity so it was forced to realize the losses on the older bonds. ([Source](https://www.barrons.com/articles/svb-silicon-valley-bank-rates-securities-693c931c)) Higher uncertainty as more bad news of losses from SVB began piling up, it led to even more deposits being withdrawn and more losses crystalizing leading to a loop of destruction. 

So, SVB wants to avoid losses, it tries to hold securities till maturity i.e. Held to maturity(HTM) assets. Accounting practices allows for HTM to be in terms of par value and not the updated value.

According to the 2022 10-K, SVB has total deposits of about 173 billion but only 118 billion in relatively liquid assets. BUT 76% of liquid assets are in HTM, that 76% is according to PAR VALUE so the actual worth of HTM today could be significantly lower.  


**Signaling**  
In finance, there's a theory called the Signaling theory.

**Large Exposure to Diversity Risk.**

SVB's main customers had more or less the same demographic so the deposits owned by SVB are more or less the same. There's very high correlation between the deposits, a withdrawal most likely will trigger another withdrawal as customers are facing the same extent of losses or same issues so the diversity risk is high.",2767,425,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11p4ghc/silicon_valley_bank_collapse_explained_in_under/,"Silicon Valley Bank Collapse Explained in under 400 words. # Introduction:

Silicon Valley Bank(SVB) is a bank that primarily serves Venture Capital/Private Equity firms in areas such as Technology and Medical start ups.

&amp;#x200B;

# Reasons:

**Interest rates environment**

In 2021, SVB received a substantial amount of deposit due to overall economy booming. It bought a lot of government treasury bonds at a low interest rate. ([Source](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bond-losses-push-silicon-valley-bank-parent-to-raise-capital-125e89d4?mod=Searchresults_pos2&amp;page=1)) Government bonds are not bad but they are exposed to interest rate risk.  
However, as the FEDs started raising interest rates it reduced the value of bonds SVB had outstanding. When FEDs raise interest rates, this leads to higher coupon rates on newer bonds so older bonds are sold off to capitalize on the higher coupon rates, which in turn reduces the price of older bonds i.e. their value.   


IF a firm had held these bonds till maturity, no losses are made. However, due to poor environment it led to lower investment into VCs so more VCs pulled their deposits out. SVB had very little liquidity so it was forced to realize the losses on the older bonds. ([Source](https://www.barrons.com/articles/svb-silicon-valley-bank-rates-securities-693c931c)) Higher uncertainty as more bad news of losses from SVB began piling up, it led to even more deposits being withdrawn and more losses crystalizing leading to a loop of destruction. 

So, SVB wants to avoid losses, it tries to hold securities till maturity i.e. Held to maturity(HTM) assets. Accounting practices allows for HTM to be in terms of par value and not the updated value.

According to the 2022 10-K, SVB has total deposits of about 173 billion but only 118 billion in relatively liquid assets. BUT 76% of liquid assets are in HTM, that 76% is according to PAR VALUE so the actual worth of HTM today could be significantly lower.

A lot of biopharma startups are listed here, and while the ones noted here say that their holding with SVB are in really small portions i'm wondering if some of the other bioparma startups (that aren't saying anything public yet) with high valuations have higher levels of exposure and are running a risk of continuing to be a going concern or SIVB might be holding their stock that may get dumped.

250K is not enough to make payroll for a few weeks... let alone continue drug studies that are the sole reason for a Bio-pharma companies valuation.

Does anyone know if SVB being the bookrunner means that these stock offering funds may be locked in an SVB account?

Silicon Valley Bank, with $212 billion in total assets as of December  31, has failed following a run on deposits, after its parent company's  share price crashed a record 60% on Thursday. Trading of SVB Financial  Group's stock was halted early Friday, after the shares plunged again in  premarket trading. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said SVB was one of a  few banks she was ""monitoring very carefully."" A liquidity problem  arose from a balance sheet heavy with securities and relatively light on  loans, in a rising-rate environment in which bond prices have declined  and in which depositors specific to that industry are themselves  suffering from a decline in cash. 

**Many banks would face significant  losses if they had to dump securities to raise cash.**

The FDIC is aiming for a swift deal but a winner may not be known until late Sunday, according to one person, who asked to not be identified because the matter isn’t public. No final decision has been made and it’s possible that no deal may be reached, said the people.

Representatives for the FDIC didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment outside regular business hours. 

Silicon Valley Bank [collapsed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-10/silicon-valley-bank-collapses-enters-fdic-receivership) into FDIC receivership on Friday, after its long-established customer base of tech startups grew concerned and yanked deposits.  


* Final bids due, winner may only be known late Sunday
* FDIC is racing to sell SVB assets before branches open Monday  


Note that this is an auction for SVB assets, not the bank itself.   FDIC is looking to resolve the matter and pay out depositors in record speed, even if it will be only 70cents on the dollar.

Note that this is an auction for SVB assets, not the bank itself.   FDIC is looking to resolve the matter and pay out depositors in record speed, even if it will be only 70cents on the dollar.

11pirnb,2023-03-12 16:30:48,wallstreetbets,Theta_Ome,How SVB Was Doomed By a Bad Bet on Mortgage Securities and the Fed’s Rate Hikes," Source: [https://www.barrons.com/articles/svb-silicon-valley-bank-rates-securities-693c931c](https://www.barrons.com/articles/svb-silicon-valley-bank-rates-securities-693c931c)

The demise of Silicon Valley Bank wasn’t driven by credit problems but by an old-fashioned mismatch of assets and liabilities that doomed many thrifts back in the 1970s.

California regulators seized Silicon Valley Bank, whose parent is Santa Clara-based [SVB Financial **SIVB** **–60.41%** ](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/sivb) (ticker: SIVB), on Friday after a deposit run. It was t[he biggest bank failure](https://www.barrons.com/articles/svb-financial-stock-portfolio-outlook-loss-93287f3d?mod=hp_LEAD_1&amp;mod=article_inline) since Washington Mutual in 2008.

Silicon Valley Bank, which catered to technology start-ups and the venture capital community, saw a huge influx of deposits from 2020 through early 2022. Deposits reached $198 billion on March 31, 2022, up from $74 billion in June 2020.

Banks need to do something with customer deposits and SVB decided to put the bulk of the money into bonds, mostly federal agency mortgage-backed securities. These carry minimal credit risk but can have sizable interest-rate risk. 

SVB’s mistake was investing in longer-term mortgage securities with more than 10 years to maturity, rather than shorter-maturity Treasuries or mortgage issues maturing in less than five years. This led to an asset/liability mismatch. 

As interest rates rose sharply and the bond market cratered in 2022 (bond prices move inversely to yields), SVB’s bond portfolio took a huge hit. At the end of 2022, SVB held $117 billion of securities, which accounted for the bulk of its $211 billion in assets. 

These bonds were showing big losses at the end of 2022, with some $91 billion of the bond portfolio, classified as “held-to-maturity” securities for accounting purposes, worth just $76 billion. 

The loss of $15 billion compared with a loss of just $1 billion at year-end 2021, before bond prices fell. The yield on that portfolio averaged just 1.6%, compared with current mortgage-securities yields of about 5%.

While that loss was real, SVB didn’t have to recognize it because accounting rules allow held-to-maturity securities to be effectively carried at their cost. The loss on those bonds would have wiped out nearly all of the bank’s $16 billion equity capital base at year-end 2022. 

While SVB was sitting on a huge economic loss, investors and analysts paid scant attention to it—until late last week. The view seemed to be that the bank would ride out the storm and that the bond portfolio would gradually mature and the losses would melt away.

In fact, SVB CEO Greg Becker appeared at a Morgan Stanley conference on March 7 and got no questions about the bank’s balance sheet, deposits, or securities portfolio. He was queried about much else—crypto, venture capital, the IPO market, and the “innovation economy.” The final question was how he “de-stressed.” 

His response: Cycling. “So cycling is my advice, for sure, living in Northern California and being on the peninsula. That’s just—I think it’s the best bike-riding cycling in the world, period. And it’s great to be going about with so many colleagues, employees and teams and venture capitalists, et cetera.” 

The bank got hit—the way thrifts did in the 1970s—because the effective maturity of its mortgage-securities portfolio lengthened as rates rose. The portfolio duration, a measure of risk, moved to six years from about four years during 2022.

SVB compounded the problem by [relying on institutional deposits](https://www.barrons.com/articles/sbv-silicon-valley-bank-biotech-a94695dd?mod=Searchresults&amp;mod=article_inline), with the vast bulk of its deposit base consisting of accounts of more than $250,000. This made it more vulnerable to a run.

Even before that, It had experienced a decline in deposits to $173 billion at year-end from $198 billion in March 2022.

“SIVB was in a league of its own: a high level of loans plus securities as a percentage of deposits, and very low reliance on stickier retail deposits as a share of its total deposit base,” wrote Michael Cembalist, the chairman of market strategy at JP Morgan Asset Management.

Things unraveled quickly for SVB. On Wednesday, it announced moves to sell some $21 billion of Treasury and agency bonds classified as available-for-sale for accounting purposes, realize a $1.8 billion loss, and raise $2.25 billion in capital.  

The plan didn’t work as depositors rushed to pull out their money. SVB shares plunged 60% to $106.04 Thursday and didn’t open for trading Friday. There might not be much recovery value for shareholders.

SVB’s loan book looks in good shape, with losses of just 0.15% on a $74 billion portfolio in the fourth quarter.

SVB was unusual because of the extent of its bond losses relative to its capital base compared with largest banks and regionals. 

The bank’s demise could prompt regulators to take a look at the accounting for bank bond portfolios that allow banks to effectively hide losses by classifying them as held to maturity. The other category for bondholdings, available for sale, needs to be carried at market value.

“This manner of classifying securities, and the different accounting treatment of each category, has always been a little problematic and certainly can be manipulated to the bank’s advantage when it feels the need to do so,” Robert Willens, a New York tax expert, wrote in an email to *Barron’s*.

Indeed, there was a rush by banks in 2022 to reclassify their bonds as “held-to-maturity” to avoid recognizing a large chunk of what the FDIC has estimated at $600 billion in losses industrywide.

The big capital hole in SVB’s balance sheet could complicate the sale of the bank because the buyer presumably would have to recapitalize it. There has been speculation that private-equity buyers have been eyeing the bank.

One potential buyer is [JPMorgan Chase **JPM** **+2.54%** ](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/jpm) (JPM) the country’s top bank, but that seems unlikely.

For starters, JPMorgan and the other largest banks don’t need deposits and might be loath to take on a loan portfolio that they didn’t underwrite. JPMorgan, for instance, could cherry-pick some of the most productive teams at SVB. Regional banks might be more attracted to its presence in Silicon Valley and relationships with the tech community.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, moreover, has vowed not to help regulators by taking over a failing institution after the legal liability the bank incurred mostly for mortgage-related activities after buying Bear Stearns and taking over Washington Mutual during the 2008 financial crisis. ",86,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11pirnb/how_svb_was_doomed_by_a_bad_bet_on_mortgage/,"How SVB Was Doomed By a Bad Bet on Mortgage Securities and the Fed’s Rate Hikes  Source: [https://www.barrons.com/articles/svb-silicon-valley-bank-rates-securities-693c931c](https://www.barrons.com/articles/svb-silicon-valley-bank-rates-securities-693c931c)

[https://www.barrons.com/articles/sbv-silicon-valley-bank-biotech-a94695dd](https://www.barrons.com/articles/sbv-silicon-valley-bank-biotech-a94695dd)

A lot of biopharma startups are listed here, and while the ones noted here say that their holding with SVB are in really small portions i'm wondering if some of the other bioparma startups (that aren't saying anything public yet) with high valuations have higher levels of exposure and are running a risk of continuing to be a going concern or SIVB might be holding their stock that may get dumped.

250K is not enough to make payroll for a few weeks... let alone continue drug studies that are the sole reason for a Bio-pharma companies valuation.

It looks like a lot of the bio-pharma was done through their subsidiarity SVB securities:

Does anyone know if SVB being the bookrunner means that these stock offering funds may be locked in an SVB account?

One way that the regulators would step in would be to create a backstop for uninsured deposits at Silicon Valley Bank, using an authority from the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, according to the source. The move would also touch the systemic risk exception that allows the Fed to take extraordinary action to stem contagion fears.

Such a move could also spur confidence at similar institutions ahead of Monday, when banks open and customers can withdraw from their accounts.

An additional step would be a “general banking facility” from the Federal Reserve that would support other financials with exposure to SVB.

The moves would likely only be necessary if the FDIC was unable to find a buyer for all of SVB, or at least key parts of it. Bloomberg News reported that the FDIC was holding an auction for the bank, with final bids due on Sunday.

The move comes after regulators shut down Silicon Valley Bank on Friday, marking the largest U.S. bank failure since 2008.

The failure was caused by tens of millions in customer deposits being withdrawn on Thursday. There has been concern among investors that other mid-sized banks could face similar pressure without federal support.",97,126,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11pmyie/fed_and_fdic_discussing_backstop_to_make_svb/,"Fed and FDIC discussing backstop to make SVB depositors whole and stem contagion fears: Source Financial regulators are discussing two different facilities to manage the fallout from the closure of Silicon Valley Bank if no buyer materializes, according to a source close to the situation.

Federal Reserve Board announces it will make available additional funding to eligible depository institutions to help assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors

To support American businesses and households, the Federal Reserve Board on Sunday announced it will make available additional funding to eligible depository institutions  to help assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors.  This action will bolster the capacity of the banking system to safeguard deposits and ensure the ongoing provision of money and credit to the economy. 

The Federal Reserve is prepared to address any liquidity pressures that may arise.

The financing will be made available through the creation of a new Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), offering loans of up to one year in length to banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other eligible depository institutions pledging U.S. Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, and other qualifying assets as collateral.  These assets will be valued at par.  The BTFP will be an additional source of liquidity against high-quality securities, eliminating an institution’s need to quickly sell those securities in times of stress.

Joint Statement by the Department of the Treasury, Federal Reserve, and FDIC
March 12, 2023
WASHINGTON, DC -- The following statement was released by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen, Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome H. Powell, and FDIC Chairman Martin J. Gruenberg:

Today we are taking decisive actions to protect the U.S. economy by strengthening public confidence in our banking system. This step will ensure that the U.S. banking system continues to perform its vital roles of protecting deposits and providing access to credit to households and businesses in a manner that promotes strong and sustainable economic growth.

After receiving a recommendation from the boards of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve, and consulting with the President, Secretary Yellen approved actions enabling the FDIC to complete its resolution of Silicon Valley Bank, Santa Clara, California, in a manner that fully protects all depositors. Depositors will have access to all of their money starting Monday, March 13.  No losses associated with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank will be borne by the taxpayer.

We are also announcing a similar systemic risk exception for Signature Bank, New York, New York, which was closed today by its state chartering authority. All depositors of this institution will be made whole.  As with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank, no losses will be borne by the taxpayer.

Shareholders and certain unsecured debtholders will not be protected. Senior management has also been removed. Any losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund to support uninsured depositors will be recovered by a special assessment on banks, as required by law.

Finally, the Federal Reserve Board on Sunday announced it will make available additional funding to eligible depository institutions to help assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors. 

The U.S. banking system remains resilient and on a solid foundation, in large part due to reforms that were made after the financial crisis that ensured better safeguards for the banking industry. Those reforms combined with today’s actions demonstrate our commitment to take the necessary steps to ensure that depositors’ savings remain safe.",2480,928,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/11pscz8/us_government_guarantees_all_silicon_valley_bank/,"U.S. government guarantees all Silicon Valley Bank deposits, money available March 13th (Monday) https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1337

Regulators seized New York regional bank Signature Bank (SBNY) two days after shutting down Silicon Valley Bank as overseers of the banking system try to restore calm before markets open Monday.

Signature becomes the third-largest bank to ever fail in the U.S., behind Silicon Valley Bank and Washington Mutual in 2008, if its assets haven't changed significantly since the end of 2022. Signature had $110 billion in assets as of Dec. 31, ranking 29th among U.S. banks. It had $88 billion in deposits as of that date.

A joint statement from the Treasury Department Secretary Janet Yellen, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg said that all deposit holders would be made whole, citing a ""systemic risk exemption"" that is also being applied to Silicon Valley Bank, but that shareholders and certain unsecured debtholders will not be protected. Senior management, they said, had been removed.

Any losses to the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund to support depositors who exceeded the $250,000-protected limit, they added, ""will be recovered by a special assessment on banks, as required by law."" The FDIC maintains the fund with regular contributions from banks.

Signature served clients in the cryptocurrency world. Like Silvergate Bank, another crypto-friendly bank that said last week it would voluntarily wind itself down, it had been suffering from an outflow in deposits in the aftermath of the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. The value of some of its securities had also dropped in value due to a rise in interest rates.

Imagine you and your friends have a lemonade stand, but you run out of money to buy more lemons and cups. The Bank Term Funding Program is like your mom giving you some money to buy what you need so you can keep selling lemonade. The banks borrow money from the government when they need it, so they can keep lending money to people and help the economy stay strong. It's like a safety net to make sure the banks don't run out of money and people can still borrow money when they need it.

**TL; DR for Adults**

The bailout is not called TARP this time it is called BTFP. The Federal Reserve has a program called the Bank Term Funding Program that helps banks, credit unions, and other types of financial institutions in the United States get money when they need it. They can borrow money from the Federal Reserve Banks by using certain types of securities, like stocks or bonds, as collateral. The program is available to banks that are doing well financially and the interest rate is set at a reasonable fixed rate. The Department of the Treasury provides a safety net in case any of the institutions that borrowed money can't pay it back. This program is a way to make sure there is enough money in the economy and it will be available until at least March 11, 2024.

## If My Grandma Mother Had a Failing Bank, I’d Explain the Above Picture to Her Like This

Grandma, the Bank Term Funding Program is a program that helps banks, credit unions, and other types of financial institutions in the United States get money when they need it.

The program allows these institutions to borrow money from the Federal Reserve Banks by using certain types of securities, like stocks or bonds, as collateral.

The program is available to any U.S. federally insured depository institution that is eligible for primary credit, meaning that they are in good financial standing. The amount that a financial institution can borrow is limited to the value of the securities that they use as collateral.

The interest rate for the program is set at a fixed rate that is based on the one-year overnight index swap rate plus 10 basis points. The program lasts for up to one year, and there are no fees associated with it.

The Department of the Treasury provides credit protection to the Federal Reserve Banks, which means that the banks have a safety net in case any of the institutions that borrowed money under the program are not able to pay it back.

The program is available until at least March 11, 2024, and borrowers can prepay their loans at any time without penalty.

## SVB &amp; Signature Bank Failed If You Didn’t Know, Again I’d Explain to My Grandma Like This

Grandma, the Federal Reserve Board has announced that it will provide additional funding to eligible banks and financial institutions to help them meet the needs of their depositors and ensure that money and credit continue to flow in the economy.

To do this, the Federal Reserve will create a new program called the Bank Term Funding Program, which will offer loans of up to one year in length to eligible institutions pledging certain types of assets as collateral. This program will be backed up by the Department of the Treasury, which will make up to $25 billion available as a safety net, although the Federal Reserve doesn't expect to need this money.

The Federal Reserve is also working closely with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to protect depositors of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, and is monitoring the financial system closely to ensure it remains stable.

Banks and financial institutions can also get liquidity from the Federal Reserve through the discount window, which is available to them. The Federal Reserve is ready to take additional steps to support households and businesses if necessary.

## What Happens Next

The Bank Term Funding Program is a valuable resource for financial institutions in need of funding, and it can be accessed by pledging certain types of securities as collateral. It's good to know that the program is available to U.S. federally insured depository institutions that are in good financial standing and that the interest rate is fixed and reasonable.

Additionally, the Department of the Treasury provides credit protection to the Federal Reserve Banks, which means that banks have a safety net if they are unable to repay the loan.

The Federal Reserve Board is also committed to supporting eligible banks and financial institutions by providing additional funding, and the Bank Term Funding Program is one of the tools it will use to ensure that money and credit continue to flow in the economy. It's reassuring to know that the Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the financial system to ensure its stability and is ready to take additional steps to support households and businesses if necessary.

In conclusion, the Bank Term Funding Program is a vital resource for U.S. financial institutions in need of immediate funds.

It allows these institutions to borrow money from the Federal Reserve Banks using securities as collateral, with a fixed interest rate and no fees.

The Department of the Treasury provides credit protection to the Federal Reserve Banks, and the program is available until at least March 11, 2024, giving eligible institutions a safety net in case of financial difficulty.

First Republic Bank FRC -14.84%decrease; red down pointing triangle said it has shored up its finances with additional funding from the Federal Reserve and JPMorgan Chase JPM 2.54%increase; green up pointing triangle &amp; Co.

The fresh funding gives the bank, which was under pressure following the collapse of SVB Financial Corp. SIVB -60.41%decrease; red down pointing triangle last week, $70 billion in unused liquidity. That doesn’t include money First Republic is eligible to borrow through a new Fed lending facility designed to help banks meet withdrawals.

“First Republic’s capital and liquidity positions are very strong, and its capital remains well above the regulatory threshold for well-capitalized banks,” the bank’s executive chairman and its chief executive said in a joint statement.

The infusion is the first such lifeline announced for a collection of midsize banks that have run into trouble in the past week. Silvergate Capital Corp. SI -11.27%decrease; red down pointing triangle on Wednesday said it would shut down after its bet on crypto customers left it with huge losses. SVB was seized by the government on Friday after a bank run. New York-based Signature Bank met the same fate Sunday. Those two closures were the second- and third-largest bank failures in history.

Investors grew concerned last week that First Republic had a similar profile to SVB. Shares of First Republic had fallen about 30% since Wednesday, and some customers started to get skittish about leaving their deposits at the bank.

“You see your bank is down 30%, that’s a little worrying,” said Abraham Parangi, chief executive of AI startup Akkio. “Even more worrying is when they tell you ‘Hey, everything’s fine!’”

As SVB floundered on Friday, Mr. Parangi said he moved 90% of his company’s cash at First Republic into an insured cash sweep program that spreads the funds around to accounts at other banks to increase the amount covered by FDIC insurance.

Venture-capital firm Omega Venture Partners sent a note to portfolio companies encouraging them to open a cash brokerage account or make sure their bank deposit accounts are insured if they had money in regional banks such as First Republic. “A spillover risk to these institutions is more likely than not!”

First Republic, which has $213 billion in assets, tried to stem the panic. On Friday, the lender released a statement saying that it had a diversified group of depositors and “over $60 billion of available, unused borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank.” On Sunday, bank executives emailed customers to reassure them about its finances.

JPMorgan officials had reached out to First Republic over the past week to tell them they were standing by to help the bank, an important client, if it needed access to funding, a person familiar with the matter said. It ultimately committed to putting up several billion dollars in a credit facility First Republic can tap, the person said.

The Federal Reserve on Sunday said it would make additional funding available to banks through a new “Bank Term Funding Program,” which will offer loans of up to one year to banks that pledge U.S. Treasury securities, mortgage-backed securities and other collateral. Up to $25 billion from the Treasury’s exchange-stabilization fund will backstop the Fed lending program.

A joint move by the Fed and Treasury Department also took the extraordinary step of designating SVB and Signature Bank as a systemic risk to the financial system, giving regulators flexibility to backstop uninsured deposits. Regulators hoped that and other moves to protect deposits would contain fallout elsewhere Monday morning.

First Republic’s business and stock-market valuation were long the envy of the banking industry. Its customers are wealthy individuals and businesses primarily on the coasts. Its lending business revolved around making huge mortgages to clients such as Mark Zuckerberg. Few of those loans ever went bad.

The bank’s profits rose in 2022, but the Fed’s aggressive rate increases took a toll. Its wealthy customers were no longer as content to leave huge sums of money in bank accounts that earned no interest.

While the bank’s deposits skewed more heavily toward wealthy individuals than SVB’s did, many of its deposits are uninsured. More than $140 billion of its deposits are in accounts that are over the limit for federal deposit insurance.

The new backing for the bank soothed Mr. Parangi’s anxiety, but he still plans on diversifying his company’s banking this week.

QE has returned, stronger than ever.","EDIT: The Fed will charge the 1 year overnight index swap rate plus 10 basis points for these loans. Sounds like right now that works out to roughly 5%, so this might be a high enough interest rate to deter banks from flooding the Fed with these long-term treasuries and effectively causing massive QE. We will have to see.

From this article:

https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/12/regulators-unveil-plan-to-stem-damage-from-svb-collapse.html

""The Fed facility will offer loans of up to one year to banks, saving associations, credit unions and other institutions. Those taking advantage of the facility will be asked to pledge high-quality collateral such as Treasurys, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities.

...the Fed said it will ease conditions at its discount window, which will use the same conditions as the BTFP. However, the new facility offers more favorable terms, with a longer duration of loans of one year vs. 90 days. Also, securities will be valued at par value rather than the market value assessed at the discount window.

The haircut, or reduction in principal, issue is critical as there are estimated to be some $600 billion in unrealized losses that institutions possess in held-to-maturity Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities.""

This means that every bank out there that stupidly bought 10,20,30 year treasuries at high prices (low yields) and are now bag-holding with unrealized losses on these bonds will run straight to the Fed and loan them to the Fed in exchange for the PAR VALUE (read, the value of the bonds at maturity - i.e. as if the banks don't have a loss on these bonds) in CASH. Now, what will the banks do with this cash? They are required to hold stable, safe assets that have a return, and that equals short term treasuries (and with the yield curve inversion, short term returns more than longer term anyway, so win-win for the banks). So, they are going to go onto the open market and buy these short term treasuries. The entities that sell them the treasuries will now be flush with cash and will likely buy stocks with that money.

The article gives the $600 billion figure as just the ON PAPER LOSSES, NOT THE VALUE OF THE BONDS. If the losses are $600B, then the overall value of the bonds' PAR value will be MULTIPLE TRILLIONS. All of those bonds will be loaned to the Fed by the end of the week, and by the end of next week, all of that money will be in the stock market.

Edit: The article does not say what kind of interest rate the Fed will charge on these loans. If the Fed charges an interest rate that is approximate to short-term treasuries, then it may not make much financial sense for banks to run out and do this wholesale. Has anyone seen any info from the Fed about the interest rate they will charge for these 1-year loans?

Edit 2: The Fed will charge the 1 year overnight index swap rate plus 10 basis points. Sounds like right now that works out to roughly 5%, maybe a bit more. So maybe it's not instantly free money for the banks, but the fact that they can borrow more than their collateral is worth could make it worth their while to take this loan.",786,289,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11pyvvj/trillions_of_dollars_are_about_to_flow_from_the/,"Trillions of dollars are about to flow from the Fed into the stock market.

Also, securities will be valued at par value rather than the market value assessed at the discount window.

The haircut, or reduction in principal, issue is critical as there are estimated to be some $600 billion in unrealized losses that institutions possess in held-to-maturity Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities.""

This means that every bank out there that stupidly bought 10,20,30 year treasuries at high prices (low yields) and are now bag-holding with unrealized losses on these bonds will run straight to the Fed and loan them to the Fed in exchange for the PAR VALUE (read, the value of the bonds at maturity - i.e. as if the banks don't have a loss on these bonds) in CASH. Now, what will the banks do with this cash? They are required to hold stable, safe assets that have a return, and that equals short term treasuries (and with the yield curve inversion, short term returns more than longer term anyway, so win-win for the banks). So, they are going to go onto the open market and buy these short term treasuries. The entities that sell them the treasuries will now be flush with cash and will likely buy stocks with that money.

The article gives the $600 billion figure as just the ON PAPER LOSSES, NOT THE VALUE OF THE BONDS. If the losses are $600B, then the overall value of the bonds' PAR value will be MULTIPLE TRILLIONS. All of those bonds will be loaned to the Fed by the end of the week, and by the end of next week, all of that money will be in the stock market.

Edit: The article does not say what kind of interest rate the Fed will charge on these loans. If the Fed charges an interest rate that is approximate to short-term treasuries, then it may not make much financial sense for banks to run out and do this wholesale. Has anyone seen any info from the Fed about the interest rate they will charge for these 1-year loans?

Edit 2: The Fed will charge the 1 year overnight index swap rate plus 10 basis points. Sounds like right now that works out to roughly 5%, maybe a bit more. So maybe it's not instantly free money for the banks, but the fact that they can borrow more than their collateral is worth could make it worth their while to take this loan."

There is a good online essay on FoundSF about this, by Gray Brechin, one of California’s present day premier historians and geographers. There’s also plenty of other material online and in print publications; even a book, Ralston’s Ring, published in 1937.

[https://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=BANK\_OF\_CALIFORNIA\_and\_WILLIAM\_RALSTON](https://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=BANK_OF_CALIFORNIA_and_WILLIAM_RALSTON)

Summary. California immigrant William Ralston founded the Bank of California in 1864. He had previously made a lot of money investing in the Comstock Lode (silver mines) in Nevada. He invested in a combination of solid business ventures and “get rich quick” schemes and speculation. Ralston’s closest business partner was William Sharon, a total amoral tool (Brechin notes *“to call Sharon a piranha would be to insult the character of the fish.”*). 

Ralston was a legendary and popular rich man, and lived large in San Francisco and in Belmont (the name of his huge country estate, which later became the name of the town.) He did some good things, developing local industry and promoting public works. He also hired mercenaries to try to overthrow the government of Nicaragua and engaged in a wide variety of unethical business practices. He was a business man of his times; *“if it took insider trading, backstabbing, and wholesale political corruption to accomplish his ends, those were the rules of the game and everyone else who could afford to play was doing the same.”*

Ralston got overextended by the mid-1870s. He had built two hotels—The Grand, and the first Palace Hotel—on Market Street, the latter at a cost of seven million dollars. He tried to save himself by getting the City of San Francisco to buy the private Spring Valley Water Company for a much inflated price, but that didn’t work out. 

On August 26, 1875, there were rumors that the Bank of California was unstable and a bank run began. Depositors frantically lined up to withdraw all their money. The bank tried to stem the run by ostentatiously putting out trays of gold coins at the cashier stations, but the lines grew and in mid afternoon the Bank ran out of cash and closed its doors. Thousands were ruined (no FDIC in those days). A run also started on a different bank across the street. The next day the directors of the Bank of California forced Ralston to resign, and turn over all his personal financial assets—including the Belmont estate—to William Sharon, who would take full advantage of them, instantly becoming one of California’s richest men out of Ralston’s ruin.

Ralston went for his daily swim in San Francisco Bay. Bystanders saw him swim far out towards Alcatraz and then struggle in the water. His body was recovered and brought back to shore. Historians still debate whether he died from a stroke, or essentially committed suicide.

Brechin concludes his essay with a quote from Ralston’s contemporary, Hubert Howe Bancroft, who wrote much of the early history of California. *“Ralston, though a daring, dashing pet of the people was a bad man and committed suicide rather than face his friends, after his frauds should become public.”*",9,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/11q0io3/the_bay_areas_original_run_on_a_bank1875/,"The Bay Area's Original Run on a Bank...1875 Lines of anxious depositors outside banks are nothing new in the Bay Area.

There’s probably a simply answer to this but isn’t the entire fractional reserve banking idea predicated on the fact that banks can essentially create money out of thin air like central banks do?

Yes you still need a fraction of the actual money in the bank, but like a is that even true anymore considering reserve requirements are zero in many countries like US I think and b even if there is a reserve requirement that still means they’re making the rest of the money out of thin air when they give you a loan for your mortgage say.

When they lend you money for your mortgage it’s not like they need full reserve backing for your mortgage anyway. They just make it up. 

So if they can do that, how come they can’t just give 100% depositors their money if they all asked to wire out their money to another bank?

Of course if everyone asked for cash then that’s different you actually need the physical cash that’s why I’m asking about digital bank runs meaning physical cash isn’t involved.",2,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/11q0zl5/remind_me_how_digital_bank_runs_are_even_possible/,"Remind me how digital bank runs are even possible under fractional reserve banking?

**A deal has been agreed for HSBC to buy the UK arm of the failed US Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), the government has announced.**

Customers and businesses who have money deposited in SVB UK will be able to access it as well as other banking services as normal, a statement said.

The Treasury said the deal with HSBC involved no taxpayer money and the Bank of England said deposits were secure.

HSBC announced it had acquired the UK subsidiary of SVB for £1.

Noel Quinn, HSBC Group chief executive, said UK customers of SVB could ""continue to bank as usual, safe in the knowledge that their deposits are backed by the strength, safety and security of HSBC"".

The deal comes after SVB - which specialised in lending to technology companies - went bust in the US on Friday in the largest failure of a US bank since the financial crisis in 2008.

Its collapse sent shockwaves across the tech industry over the possible impact it could have on businesses, with some firms telling the BBC they could go bust if deposits were not secured.

Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the tech sector was of ""huge importance"" to the British economy and supported hundreds of thousands of jobs.

He said the sale, facilitated by the government and the Bank of England, ""ensures customer deposits are protected and can bank as normal, with no taxpayer support"".

Mr Hunt added with HSBC being Europe's largest bank, ""UK customers should feel reassured by the strength, safety and security that brings them"".

**Fictional Story :** 

\*Opens door in US office ( March 6, 2023 )

( Investors = Legendary Investors )

&amp;#x200B;

Investors: Hey Des long time no see. Where have you been?

Me:  Didn't I say I was in India?

&amp;#x200B;

Investors: No, we meant. Why didn't you come to the party last Friday night hotel? We all had so much fun. We missed you, man.

Me: Well I was just busy.

&amp;#x200B;

Investors: Busy? What have you been doing behind our backs?

Me: Nothing. I was just watching tv shows and anime that I missed. Thats all. I was really tired.

&amp;#x200B;

Investors: You know that we don't believe you right?

Me: Why would I lie to you guys? I have always been loyal, and honest and have given everything to this company.

&amp;#x200B;

Investors: If you have given everything you wouldn't have made a silly mistake you know. You were wrong about high vix Jan. A lot of clients lost their money.

Me: God! Are you guys going to keep it hanging over my head for the rest of my life? I delivered the Q1 disaster and that was the promise I made in the summer of 2022 report. How would I know that the market was going for a huge sideways pattern back then? Also, I took a winter vacation to attend my sister’s wedding.

&amp;#x200B;

Investors: Nah you were just wrong.

Me: I hate you guys. I am going to the club to meet my friends from the tech space. You guys have fun.

&amp;#x200B;

Investors: Well Des you know we have some information for you. We are planning to use a legendary pattern on Wall street again. Do you want in just like the last time?

Me: But haven't we already used the 7yr one in sept the last yr? Liss Truss had to resign because of that. I think it was the last jutsu in our arsenal. What else pattern there is left?

&amp;#x200B;

Investors: God you and your anime reference. We never get it. Well, things have changed my friend.

Me: What are you guys talking about?

&amp;#x200B;

Investors : \*Shows chart. Well, this is the chart pattern one of our guys drew.

Me : \*looking at the chart. This is impossible. How is this supposed to happen?

&amp;#x200B;

Investors: Well we didn’t say it will happen but there is a slight possibility it may happen. This is an even rarest of all patterns. No one on Wall street knows about it. They are always late to find this kind of thing. This has happened just three times in the entire history of America.

Me: C'mon guys. You promised we would long America after $3200 and then we were supposed to go ATH and analyze things again.

&amp;#x200B;

Investors: You are a simple guy Des. Go enjoy your free time. We will talk more later.

Me: Sigh! Do whatever you guys want. See y’all later. Peace.

&amp;#x200B;

\* Leaving office

Me : ( Should I give Wsb a heads up. Hmm )

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Intro :**

Respected Traders and Investors,

A very Good morning to y’all. How are you folks doing? 

&amp;#x200B;

No seriously guys, how are you doing? I really am concerned and I wanted to check up on you so tell me you are fine and you’re **growing vegetables in your garden**. Tell me you don’t have your entire savings in your bank account and have some **cash lying in your corner**. Tell me your portfolio is positioned for **short equities + long bonds + long gold** which can help you fight any kind of environment going forward. Every important detail was discussed in this series. Everything! So if any of you are experiencing a bad time then I am extremely sorry. I cannot help you more than this. I mean the whole purpose of this series is to protect the little guys so that big guys can never screw us. Whatever curve ball they throw at us we can easily survive it together against any of their shenanigans.

&amp;#x200B;

Now you guys might be like: “Calm down friend. **Uninsured depositors** are getting their money back. Everything is just fine. Fed is back to printing days. Take your medicine or change your doctor. We need your calm composure, not your Adderall dosage character”

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah guys I think you’re right. I am not doing great. **I have to quit now**. I get very emotional sometimes seeing my Twitter feed. This positional trading **was really all fun and games until banks start collapsing**. Sometimes I feel like puking tbh. No guys I am not drunk today and neither have I partied hard this Friday night with my bear friends. It’s just that all of my **tech bro’s** were gonna be in huge **trouble** and if going forward **systemic risk** really generates up in the system they **will get laid-off** come later this year.  So it’s just really sad you know. But then there are my **finance bro’s** as well who don’t want uninsured depositors over 250K to have their money back. They are saying why they even put money in SVB in the first place. **Why didn’t they do research?** So I am still kinda confused tbh and my head spinning. **I don't know who is right or wrong**. But one thing we can all agree on is at least there shouldn’t be any buyout for equity and bondholders in the banks. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So moving forward :

It’s been more than two weeks since I last posted my two **“Dragon King Newsletters”.** I am seriously regretting my decision now. Why did I ever post them in the first place? I was really afraid and scared of what I saw back then, a **technical storm** was brewing up **in the forex market and especially the bond market** which eventually I feared **would spread across the stock market** and other kinds of global markets as well. Look around you now. All of this really impacted people’s daily lives. **Forensic experts in economics, the stock market** and people who hold high positions in our society were all over the place, be it on Twitter, Youtube, and Reddit asking questions and trying to **examine the problem through the lenses of financial and tech** perspectives. Everyone on the street has his/her opinion and talks about how **no one saw it coming this early**. The key word is this early. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now some of you might be wondering “Dude you saw it all happening in Q1 back in the summer of 2022. You were not right about high vix Jan but you were definitely right about something by the end of march 2023 i.e. **Q1 disaster**. You totally predicted all of this.” 

&amp;#x200B;

No guys if I am being honest I did not foresee this. Yeah, it’s completely true this is not the kind of event I foresaw. I saw another **multiple compression ( 16 PE ) meets a low EPS (210-200)**, a basic principle leg down when yields shoot higher. This was not a multiple compression, this was going to be a freakin **flight to safety** trade for the **Banking crisis recession**. This could have easily turned into a **Black swan** kind of event. All of this shouldn’t be happening right now this early in 1H 2023. This playbook was to be deployed in the 2H of 2023.

&amp;#x200B;

Those who don’t know what I saw have to **go back and read** those newsletters titled **S02E06 and S02E07** when 10yr bond yields were trading around 3.36%. **People** back then **were saying**  “Hey we have a **new bull market**” “**No recession**”  “**Soft** landing” “**No** landing” blah blah. They even said historically low “**equity risk premium**” doesn’t mean anything and they have been saying “**Yield curve inversion**” doesn't mean anything either for the last 1 yr coz conventional wisdom would say resteepening of the std yield curve above 0% causes recession. What else they said oh yeah bond yields higher than the s&amp;p500 yield doesn't mean anything either. And then they always kept repeating buy stocks coz no one can time the market. **Time in the market matters more than timing the markets**. And the famous one of all ""**Everything is priced in already**. Even JP Morgan's collapse tomorrow will be priced in. **The market** is always **forward-looking** and is so **efficient**"" 

&amp;#x200B;

What a fucking BS this all is. We have been **fed lies by everyone** in the last couple of months. And if it was not for the Fed and Treasury which meets every week with the top 4 banks this crisis would have resulted in a Black Monday selloff. Btw the market hasn’t opened yet and I still have some time before I complete this letter. So I gotta hurry. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I will just stop ranting and move on to the analysis we will be doing here today. I am sure many of you are smart enough to figure out what. No, I am not going to talk about what everyone on Twitter is talking. I mean you guys don’t come here for things that everyone else knows. You guys come here to get my unique perspective on the financial market and how I see it going from here. That’s what we do here. We will leave the forensics to SEC, Govt, Treasury,  Fed, and every Economist on Twitter and Yt. That’s just not how we roll.

&amp;#x200B;

Understanding Banking Crisis : 

&amp;#x200B;

There have been many banking crisis ( on top of the recession ) in America’s history but you have to understand that Dow Jones only go as far as 26 May 1896. That means the models you will be creating for your organizations and your clients will not take into account many banking crisis before that. So in layman's terms, the industry std is basically a -50% drop in a recession with a banking crisis on top of it. A normal recession will always be -30% but a deep recession goes -37% on avg meanwhile a shallow one is -25%.

&amp;#x200B;

So let’s first verify this statement of a -50% drop in a recession involving a banking crisis. 

&amp;#x200B;

1907 : 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dwbrs23wogna1.png?width=437&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=97ce0e4a9a214632af9712b684097cd41e4f98f7

Theory : 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Panic of 1907, also known as the Knickerbocker Crisis, was a financial crisis that occurred in the United States in 1907. The crisis began in October of that year and lasted until early November. The panic was caused by a number of factors, including the failure of several banks and trust companies, a run on the banks by depositors, and a shortage of cash reserves.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;One of the main causes of the crisis was the overexpansion of credit in the United States. During the years leading up to 1907, there was a boom in the stock market and a period of rapid economic growth. Banks and other financial institutions were eager to lend money to businesses and investors, which led to a surge in credit. However, this expansion of credit was unsustainable, and when the economy slowed down, many borrowers were unable to repay their loans.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Another factor that contributed to the crisis was the proliferation of trust companies. Trust companies were similar to banks in that they accepted deposits and made loans, but they were not subject to the same regulations as banks. As a result, many trust companies engaged in risky lending practices, which left them vulnerable to financial shocks.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The crisis began on October 21, 1907, when the Knickerbocker Trust Company, one of the largest trust companies in New York City, announced that it was insolvent. This caused panic among depositors, who rushed to withdraw their money from other banks and trust companies. This, in turn, led to a shortage of cash reserves, which made it difficult for banks to meet the demand for withdrawals.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;To prevent the crisis from spreading further, a group of bankers, led by J.P. Morgan, intervened. They provided loans to struggling banks and trust companies and persuaded other bankers to do the same. They also organized a consortium of banks, known as the Clearing House Association, which agreed to lend money to any member bank that was in need.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Through these actions, the bankers were able to restore confidence in the financial system, and the crisis began to subside. However, the crisis had a significant impact on the economy. Many businesses were forced to close, and unemployment rose. The crisis also led to increased scrutiny of the banking system, which eventually led to the creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;In conclusion, the 1907 banking crisis in America was caused by a combination of factors, including overexpansion of credit, risky lending practices, and the proliferation of unregulated trust companies. The crisis led to a run on the banks and a shortage of cash reserves, which threatened to spread throughout the financial system. However, the crisis was ultimately contained by the intervention of a group of bankers, who provided loans and restored confidence in the system. The crisis had a significant impact on the economy and led to increased scrutiny of the banking system, which ultimately led to the creation of the Federal Reserve System.

&amp;#x200B;

Technicals :

Now that we know a little about the Panic of 1907 from our friend AI. It’s time to observe it through the lens of technicals. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ff73zrlbpgna1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=23839bf996be8561913e4e270ce8420497fd7233

&amp;#x200B;

What we can observe here is recession was about to have a -26.81% drop and then we were supposed to have a new bull market after bouncing from 200wMA but then because of the banking crisis on top of it the drop was almost -50%. The exact number would be -48.54%. So how do we identify when the banking crisis will hit on top of the recession? Well, look no further than 200wMA in DJI. When price action comes visit it 2nd time you need to remember it acts like a quick sand and then you know you are going to have dark ages all over again. Now it’s entirely up to you if you chose to fight the dark ages or not with the help of flip-flopping Federal Reserve behind your back. 

&amp;#x200B;

To summarize if you observe the recession drop was -26.81% ( wave 1 down ) and then another -28.16% ( wave 5 down ) for the banking crisis. The overall drop was = -48.54%. Wave 2 to 3 of -18.56% was just a confirmation wave that we are going to have a banking crisis. Easy peasy right.

1929 :

Theory :

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The 1929-1932 banking crisis, also known as the Great Depression, was a severe economic downturn that occurred in the United States and other parts of the world during the 1930s. The crisis was triggered by the stock market crash of 1929, which led to a sharp decline in economic activity and widespread unemployment.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;One of the primary causes of the crisis was the overexpansion of credit in the 1920s. During this time, there was a speculative boom in the stock market and a period of rapid economic growth. Banks and other financial institutions were eager to lend money to businesses and investors, which led to a surge in credit. However, this expansion of credit was unsustainable, and when the economy slowed down, many borrowers were unable to repay their loans.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The stock market crash of 1929 marked the beginning of the crisis. The crash was caused by a number of factors, including overvaluation of stocks, excessive speculation, and a decline in consumer spending. The crash led to a panic among investors, who rushed to sell their shares, which caused stock prices to plummet.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The decline in stock prices had a ripple effect throughout the economy. Many businesses were forced to close, and unemployment rose sharply. This, in turn, led to a wave of bank failures, as businesses and individuals were unable to repay their loans. As banks began to fail, depositors rushed to withdraw their money, which led to a shortage of cash reserves and further bank failures.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;To address the crisis, the US government and the Federal Reserve System implemented a number of measures. The government passed a series of laws aimed at regulating the banking system and restoring confidence in the financial system. The Federal Reserve System implemented a number of monetary policies aimed at increasing the money supply and lowering interest rates.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;However, these measures were not enough to stop the crisis from continuing. The crisis persisted until the late 1930s, when the US government began implementing a series of New Deal programs aimed at stimulating the economy and creating jobs.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;In conclusion, the 1929-1932 banking crisis was caused by a combination of factors, including overexpansion of credit, a speculative boom in the stock market, and a decline in consumer spending. The crisis led to a wave of bank failures, which contributed to a sharp rise in unemployment and a decline in economic activity. The crisis was addressed by a combination of government regulation and monetary policy, but it persisted until the late 1930s, when the US government began implementing a series of New Deal programs. The crisis had a profound impact on the US economy and the world, and it led to significant changes in the way that governments and central banks approached economic policy.

I am sure many guys on Twitter or Reddit or Youtube have already bored you with this pattern which totally looks like a period from 2000-2022. But these folks have no clue how to use it. Allow me to show you how. Just like the prev pattern we had a -46.20% drop for recession. The reason we had the drop this much was due to the fact that it was a gigantic super-bubble. That’s why it was 2x amplified. So you have to divide everything by 2. Hence 23.10% seems fair for a drop till 200wMA i.e a recessionary drop. Then again we had a rally up which btw in the textbook is called back to normal. It was only a few months later that we realized “oh uh” there is going to be a banking crisis on top of it. Hence the stock market came to test 200wMA a second time. Just like prev 1907 times the MA acted like quicksand. Hence initiated the financial crisis drop on top of it in wave 5. The overall drop had to be -45 to -50% but it was amplified by a factor of 2 hence the drop was almost -90%.

2008 : 

&amp;#x200B;

Theory : 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The 2008 banking crisis, also known as the Global Financial Crisis, was a severe economic downturn that began in the United States and quickly spread throughout the world. The crisis was triggered by a number of factors, including the subprime mortgage crisis, the securitization of mortgages, and the use of complex financial instruments.  
&gt;  
&gt;The subprime mortgage crisis was caused by the widespread issuance of subprime mortgages to borrowers who were unlikely to be able to repay them. These mortgages were then packaged together and sold as securities to investors, many of whom were not aware of the risks involved. When many of these borrowers defaulted on their loans, the value of these securities plummeted, which led to a crisis in the financial markets.  
&gt;  
&gt;The securitization of mortgages and the use of complex financial instruments, such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and credit default swaps (CDSs), also contributed to the crisis. These instruments were used to spread the risk of default across multiple parties, but they were often poorly understood and underregulated, which led to a systemic breakdown in the financial system.  
&gt;  
&gt;The crisis began in the US housing market but quickly spread to other parts of the economy. Many large financial institutions, including Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, and AIG, were heavily exposed to these complex financial instruments and suffered massive losses as a result. As these institutions began to fail, there was a panic among investors and depositors, which led to a shortage of liquidity in the financial system.  
&gt;  
&gt;To address the crisis, the US government and other governments around the world implemented a number of measures. The US government passed the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which provided funds to troubled financial institutions in exchange for equity stakes. The Federal Reserve System implemented a number of monetary policies aimed at increasing the money supply and stabilizing the financial system. Central banks around the world also implemented similar measures.  
&gt;  
&gt;The crisis had a profound impact on the global economy, and many countries experienced a sharp decline in economic activity and a rise in unemployment. The crisis also led to significant changes in the regulatory landscape, with many governments implementing stricter regulations on financial institutions and complex financial instruments.  
&gt;  
&gt;In conclusion, the 2008 banking crisis was caused by a combination of factors, including the subprime mortgage crisis, the securitization of mortgages, and the use of complex financial instruments. The crisis had a profound impact on the global economy and led to significant changes in the regulatory landscape. The crisis highlighted the need for better risk management and regulation in the financial sector, and it continues to have an impact on the way that governments and financial institutions approach economic policy.

Technicals: 

It's the same thing happening over here and most of us have probably lived it when we were young. If you were not even born when this was happening I suggest kindly step out of the market. This analysis is just not meant for you 14yr olds.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2022 :  

&amp;#x200B;

Well, let's see how this turns out. But the one thing you guys can expect from this is that the bubble really is not in SPX and DJI. I have been saying this since last summer. It's the Nasdaq that needs to die. Yeah, tech buddies you guys need to go. Tech is a boom-bust cycle of 20yrs. You have to come to terms with this. You just cannot escape your fate. It's just like your crypto buddies who were not able to escape their 4yrs fate. So I humbly request you to kindly give up. You are just overloading the banking system.

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Conclusions** : 

The banking Crisis Recession can be categorized into 5 wave principles. No, I am not trying to do an Elliot wave here. So please advanced technical traders do not get confused.

&amp;#x200B;

Wave 1 : ( 200wMA I )

Recessionary drop.

&amp;#x200B;

Wave 2 :  ( Big Impulse I )

Impulse up i.e. Back to Normal.

&amp;#x200B;

Wave 3 : ( 200wMA II )

Confirmation signal for Banking Crisis coming where the quicksand happens and 200wMA acts like a magnet.

&amp;#x200B;

Wave 4 : ( Short Impulse II )

Small impulse up till 200wMA as resistance.

&amp;#x200B;

Wave 5 : ( Thee final Drop )

The Banking Crisis Unleashed.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

|S.No|Wave 1|Wave 2|Wave 3 |Wave 4|Wave 5|Overall|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1907|\-26.81%|\+12.78%|\-18.56%|\+6.70%|\-28.26%|\-48.54%|
|1929|\-49.40%|\+52.16%|\-30.11%|\+19.00%|\-83.59%|\-89.49%|
|2008|\-18.05%|\+12.91%|\-17.58%|\+9.60%|\-45.48%|\-54.43%|
|2022|\-22.44%|\+21.11%|?|?|?|?|
|(1907+2008) /2|\-22.43%||\-18.07%||\-36.87%||
|Average of three prev||||||\-64.15%|

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If we are expecting a banking crisis this year then the overall markets should drop greater than -45% but less than -64.15% ( average of three crashes). Do remember that the rough industry std is -50% but if I were to pick a random arbitrary number I would pick :

2022-23 overall DJI drop should be = -51.485% ( avg of 1907 and 2008 )

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Result :** 

This pattern will take time to activate. I can attach timestamps to it but I don’t think it would be necessary. All you have to understand is the wave-like price action 12345 and make your own decision on which wave you will trade. I cannot keep helping you guys. It’s about time you learn to catch fish yourself and stop complaining. Positional trading is not everyone’s cup of tea and it requires a lot of patience. Most people don’t have this.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Invalidation :** 

Every theory must have an invalidation. This is the one for me. What if we go up from here and only to crash later in Oct 2008? ( Hint: Quadruple Witching of March, Sept Low Liquidity attack which Fed still doesn't understand. )

People who read my past posts : 

&amp;#x200B;

""Desmond you are a traitor. Why did you sell off $FAZ etf. We were going to crush banks with you. We trusted you man. How could you do this to us""

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah guys I am not interested in crushing banks and hence took profits. I have told you all this before it is my personal vendetta and hence it shouldn't be yours. The question you should be asking is why is SPX short low. Well, folks, I wanted to reduce my position to get a better avg price so that any rallies that may come will be faded using that cash balance. As for bonds yah I sold them to buy more JD, 3x Chinese etf, and some gold miners' stocks. Overall my short position must be in the range of 50-60% now. I haven't calculated it coz I am writing this letter way fast.

P.s. Rumors are circulating around that your trading brokers may go insolvent Ex : Schwab, Robinhood, TD, etc. Now I don't know the full truth about it but I would advise you guys to not go all in with your savings in any broker. When the banking crisis hit you have no idea who is underwater and playing with customers' deposits. Let's just be clear it's just a rumor I heard on Twitter and no way i can prove it.

&amp;#x200B;

Important message :

Many new people don't know that I started this portfolio with $100 in Wall Street Newsletter in the hopes I will turn it into $10,000 in no time without using any options. So basically by predicting all bear market rallies with you guys, it grew $430+. I wish I had access to the US options market but I just don't.

**Closing thoughts :** 

No one really knows what is going to happen. If someone really knows what will happen please do comments down below. I really wanna know your theory going up for 2023. 

But today i am going to tell you a story and maybe you can draw some lessons from it. So the thing is my sister is at a medical university who paid x amt of money until the completion of her 4yrs. The authorities over there are now telling students to pay an additional same x amt more fees during their final internship phase otherwise they would not receive their medical degree. ( Maybe they are underwater in the financial market as well xD ) The message I wanted to convey to you guys from this story is that fraud, corruption and all sorts of dirty things are going to start happening from this yr. You thought scam comments in Yt, Twitter, and Discord were bad you guys have no idea what's in the store. So be vigilant in making any sort of financial decisions. Everyone out there is there to get you when the real austerity begins. If you haven't experienced the ""Legitimate things turning fraud cycle"" yourself then you might not be ready for this.

**Acknowledgment:** 

&amp;#x200B;

I would be lying if I said I have never watched any finance experts in my life. So I would like to thank some people who have been really helpful with their research in helping me throughout my finance journey. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Mike Wilson: Thank you for taking one for the team. Without you capitulating this would have not been possible sir. You really are the best tactical trader that I have ever seen on Bloomberg.
* Katie Stockton: Thanks for always shorting SPX above $3900 since Nov 2nd week. Also thanks to your friend Liss. You two are really the best folks to watch on Cnbc.
* Market Makers: Thank you, sir. I learned some advanced technical from you. These DW kind of indicators really helps me a lot when I try to put my macroeconomic research on top of it.
* Inthemoney: Thank you, man. You have taught people like us trading options and I wish I had taken the advice you gave me personally that the market can go sideways. Learned that the hard way. xD
* Maverick of Wall Street: Thank you for staying in the Stagflation camp man. It was really lonely when everyone was talking about disinflation. Even I panicked and had to hedge using bonds and the funny thing is I still do. Your jokes in the morning really make my day.
* All in Podcast &amp; Weekly startups: If you guys haven’t watched it you sure as hell are missing a lot. No words are enough to describe how awesome these podcasts are. Whatever discussion these guys have becomes the talk of the town for next week. 
* Block works Macro: The lineup these guys come up with is really mind-blowing. My fav ones have always been Lyn, Joseph, and Howell. The hosts of this show are equally amazing as well.
* Meet Kevin: Regardless of what anyone says he is still the most hardworking guy I have ever seen on Yt. The work ethic Kevin has is simply so hard for anyone to match. If you are looking for a daily macro research topic he is the guy to follow.
* Also thanks to the anonymous experienced investors who always try to give me advice like having a backup plan, invalidation cases, and not catching fish for others
* And thank you to everyone from Reddit and Twitter who has ever traded with me. Without you guys, this journey would not have been so successful. I know season 2 sucked in comparison to season 1 just like any other tv show from its highs. I will definitely try to improve more in next season 3 which releases in 2028 or maybe 2029. 
* Last and finally I would like to thank all the Legendary Investors in our space. Without your interviews on YT about finance I would have never learned anything. It's because of you folks that I am always calm and composed while i am investing or trading.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess this is how a goodbye feels like. Sayonara Everyone. We will soon meet again in 2028-29.

**Fictional Story :** 

\*Opens door in US office ( March 6, 2023 )

( Investors = Legendary Investors )

&amp;#x200B;

Investors: Hey Des long time no see. Where have you been?

Me:  Didn't I say I was in India?

&amp;#x200B;

Investors: No, we meant. Why didn't you come to the party last Friday night hotel? We all had so much fun. We missed you, man.

Me: Well I was just busy.

&amp;#x200B;

Investors: Busy? What have you been doing behind our backs?

Me: Nothing. I was just watching tv shows and anime that I missed. Thats all. I was really tired.

&amp;#x200B;

Investors: You know that we don't believe you right?

Me: Why would I lie to you guys? I have always been loyal, and honest and have given everything to this company.

&amp;#x200B;

Investors: If you have given everything you wouldn't have made a silly mistake you know. You were wrong about high vix Jan. A lot of clients lost their money.

Me: God! Are you guys going to keep it hanging over my head for the rest of my life? I delivered the Q1 disaster and that was the promise I made in the summer of 2022 report. How would I know that the market was going for a huge sideways pattern back then? Also, I took a winter vacation to attend my sister’s wedding.

&amp;#x200B;

Investors: Nah you were just wrong.

Me: I hate you guys. I am going to the club to meet my friends from the tech space. You guys have fun.

&amp;#x200B;

Investors: Well Des you know we have some information for you. We are planning to use a legendary pattern on Wall street again. Do you want in just like the last time?

Me: But haven't we already used the 7yr one in sept the last yr? Liss Truss had to resign because of that. I think it was the last jutsu in our arsenal. What else pattern there is left?

&amp;#x200B;

Investors: God you and your anime reference. We never get it. Well, things have changed my friend.

Me: What are you guys talking about?

&amp;#x200B;

Investors : \*Shows chart. Well, this is the chart pattern one of our guys drew.

Me : \*looking at the chart. This is impossible. How is this supposed to happen?

&amp;#x200B;

Investors: Well we didn’t say it will happen but there is a slight possibility it may happen. This is an even rarest of all patterns. No one on Wall street knows about it. They are always late to find this kind of thing. This has happened just three times in the entire history of America.

Me: C'mon guys. You promised we would long America after $3200 and then we were supposed to go ATH and analyze things again.

&amp;#x200B;

Investors: You are a simple guy Des. Go enjoy your free time. We will talk more later.

Me: Sigh! Do whatever you guys want. See y’all later. Peace.

&amp;#x200B;

\* Leaving office

Me : ( Should I give Wsb a heads up. Hmm )

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Intro :**

Respected Traders and Investors,

A very Good morning to y’all. How are you folks doing? 

&amp;#x200B;

No seriously guys, how are you doing? I really am concerned and I wanted to check up on you so tell me you are fine and you’re **growing vegetables in your garden**. Tell me you don’t have your entire savings in your bank account and have some **cash lying in your corner**. Tell me your portfolio is positioned for **short equities + long bonds + long gold** which can help you fight any kind of environment going forward. Every important detail was discussed in this series. Everything! So if any of you are experiencing a bad time then I am extremely sorry. I cannot help you more than this. I mean the whole purpose of this series is to protect the little guys so that big guys can never screw us. Whatever curve ball they throw at us we can easily survive it together against any of their shenanigans.

&amp;#x200B;

Now you guys might be like: “Calm down friend. **Uninsured depositors** are getting their money back. Everything is just fine. Fed is back to printing days. Take your medicine or change your doctor. We need your calm composure, not your Adderall dosage character”

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah guys I think you’re right. I am not doing great. **I have to quit now**. I get very emotional sometimes seeing my Twitter feed. This positional trading **was really all fun and games until banks start collapsing**. Sometimes I feel like puking tbh. No guys I am not drunk today and neither have I partied hard this Friday night with my bear friends. It’s just that all of my **tech bro’s** were gonna be in huge **trouble** and if going forward **systemic risk** really generates up in the system they **will get laid-off** come later this year.  So it’s just really sad you know. But then there are my **finance bro’s** as well who don’t want uninsured depositors over 250K to have their money back. They are saying why they even put money in SVB in the first place. **Why didn’t they do research?** So I am still kinda confused tbh and my head spinning. **I don't know who is right or wrong**. But one thing we can all agree on is at least there shouldn’t be any buyout for equity and bondholders in the banks. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So moving forward :

It’s been more than two weeks since I last posted my two **“Dragon King Newsletters”.** I am seriously regretting my decision now. Why did I ever post them in the first place? I was really afraid and scared of what I saw back then, a **technical storm** was brewing up **in the forex market and especially the bond market** which eventually I feared **would spread across the stock market** and other kinds of global markets as well. Look around you now. All of this really impacted people’s daily lives. **Forensic experts in economics, the stock market** and people who hold high positions in our society were all over the place, be it on Twitter, Youtube, and Reddit asking questions and trying to **examine the problem through the lenses of financial and tech** perspectives. Everyone on the street has his/her opinion and talks about how **no one saw it coming this early**. The key word is this early. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now some of you might be wondering “Dude you saw it all happening in Q1 back in the summer of 2022. You were not right about high vix Jan but you were definitely right about something by the end of march 2023 i.e. **Q1 disaster**. You totally predicted all of this.” 

&amp;#x200B;

No guys if I am being honest I did not foresee this. Yeah, it’s completely true this is not the kind of event I foresaw. I saw another **multiple compression ( 16 PE ) meets a low EPS (210-200)**, a basic principle leg down when yields shoot higher. This was not a multiple compression, this was going to be a freakin **flight to safety** trade for the **Banking crisis recession**. This could have easily turned into a **Black swan** kind of event. All of this shouldn’t be happening right now this early in 1H 2023. This playbook was to be deployed in the 2H of 2023.

&amp;#x200B;

Those who don’t know what I saw have to **go back and read** those newsletters titled **S02E06 and S02E07** when 10yr bond yields were trading around 3.36%. **People** back then **were saying**  “Hey we have a **new bull market**” “**No recession**”  “**Soft** landing” “**No** landing” blah blah. They even said historically low “**equity risk premium**” doesn’t mean anything and they have been saying “**Yield curve inversion**” doesn't mean anything either for the last 1 yr coz conventional wisdom would say resteepening of the std yield curve above 0% causes recession. What else they said oh yeah bond yields higher than the s&amp;p500 yield doesn't mean anything either. And then they always kept repeating buy stocks coz no one can time the market. **Time in the market matters more than timing the markets**. And the famous one of all ""**Everything is priced in already**. Even JP Morgan's collapse tomorrow will be priced in. **The market** is always **forward-looking** and is so **efficient**"" 

&amp;#x200B;

What a fucking BS this all is. We have been **fed lies by everyone** in the last couple of months. And if it was not for the Fed and Treasury which meets every week with the top 4 banks this crisis would have resulted in a Black Monday selloff. Btw the market hasn’t opened yet and I still have some time before I complete this letter. So I gotta hurry. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I will just stop ranting and move on to the analysis we will be doing here today. I am sure many of you are smart enough to figure out what. No, I am not going to talk about what everyone on Twitter is talking. I mean you guys don’t come here for things that everyone else knows. You guys come here to get my unique perspective on the financial market and how I see it going from here. That’s what we do here. We will leave the forensics to SEC, Govt, Treasury,  Fed, and every Economist on Twitter and Yt. That’s just not how we roll.

&amp;#x200B;

Understanding Banking Crisis : 

&amp;#x200B;

There have been many banking crisis ( on top of the recession ) in America’s history but you have to understand that Dow Jones only go as far as 26 May 1896. That means the models you will be creating for your organizations and your clients will not take into account many banking crisis before that. So in layman's terms, the industry std is basically a -50% drop in a recession with a banking crisis on top of it. A normal recession will always be -30% but a deep recession goes -37% on avg meanwhile a shallow one is -25%.

&amp;#x200B;

So let’s first verify this statement of a -50% drop in a recession involving a banking crisis. 

&amp;#x200B;

1907 : 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dwbrs23wogna1.png?width=437&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=97ce0e4a9a214632af9712b684097cd41e4f98f7

Theory :

&gt;The Panic of 1907, also known as the Knickerbocker Crisis, was a financial crisis that occurred in the United States in 1907. The crisis began in October of that year and lasted until early November. The panic was caused by a number of factors, including the failure of several banks and trust companies, a run on the banks by depositors, and a shortage of cash reserves.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;One of the main causes of the crisis was the overexpansion of credit in the United States. During the years leading up to 1907, there was a boom in the stock market and a period of rapid economic growth. Banks and other financial institutions were eager to lend money to businesses and investors, which led to a surge in credit. However, this expansion of credit was unsustainable, and when the economy slowed down, many borrowers were unable to repay their loans.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Another factor that contributed to the crisis was the proliferation of trust companies. Trust companies were similar to banks in that they accepted deposits and made loans, but they were not subject to the same regulations as banks. As a result, many trust companies engaged in risky lending practices, which left them vulnerable to financial shocks.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The crisis began on October 21, 1907, when the Knickerbocker Trust Company, one of the largest trust companies in New York City, announced that it was insolvent. This caused panic among depositors, who rushed to withdraw their money from other banks and trust companies. This, in turn, led to a shortage of cash reserves, which made it difficult for banks to meet the demand for withdrawals.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;To prevent the crisis from spreading further, a group of bankers, led by J.P. Morgan, intervened. They provided loans to struggling banks and trust companies and persuaded other bankers to do the same. They also organized a consortium of banks, known as the Clearing House Association, which agreed to lend money to any member bank that was in need.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Through these actions, the bankers were able to restore confidence in the financial system, and the crisis began to subside. However, the crisis had a significant impact on the economy. Many businesses were forced to close, and unemployment rose. The crisis also led to increased scrutiny of the banking system, which eventually led to the creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;In conclusion, the 1907 banking crisis in America was caused by a combination of factors, including overexpansion of credit, risky lending practices, and the proliferation of unregulated trust companies. The crisis led to a run on the banks and a shortage of cash reserves, which threatened to spread throughout the financial system. However, the crisis was ultimately contained by the intervention of a group of bankers, who provided loans and restored confidence in the system. The crisis had a significant impact on the economy and led to increased scrutiny of the banking system, which ultimately led to the creation of the Federal Reserve System.

Technicals :

Now that we know a little about the Panic of 1907 from our friend AI. It’s time to observe it through the lens of technicals. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What we can observe here is recession was about to have a -26.81% drop and then we were supposed to have a new bull market after bouncing from 200wMA but then because of the banking crisis on top of it the drop was almost -50%. The exact number would be -48.54%. So how do we identify when the banking crisis will hit on top of the recession? Well, look no further than 200wMA in DJI. When price action comes visit it 2nd time you need to remember it acts like a quick sand and then you know you are going to have dark ages all over again. Now it’s entirely up to you if you chose to fight the dark ages or not with the help of flip-flopping Federal Reserve behind your back. 

&amp;#x200B;

To summarize if you observe the recession drop was -26.81% ( wave 1 down ) and then another -28.16% ( wave 5 down ) for the banking crisis. The overall drop was = -48.54%. Wave 2 to 3 of -18.56% was just a confirmation wave that we are going to have a banking crisis. Easy peasy right.

Theory :

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The 1929-1932 banking crisis, also known as the Great Depression, was a severe economic downturn that occurred in the United States and other parts of the world during the 1930s. The crisis was triggered by the stock market crash of 1929, which led to a sharp decline in economic activity and widespread unemployment.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;One of the primary causes of the crisis was the overexpansion of credit in the 1920s. During this time, there was a speculative boom in the stock market and a period of rapid economic growth. Banks and other financial institutions were eager to lend money to businesses and investors, which led to a surge in credit. However, this expansion of credit was unsustainable, and when the economy slowed down, many borrowers were unable to repay their loans.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The stock market crash of 1929 marked the beginning of the crisis. The crash was caused by a number of factors, including overvaluation of stocks, excessive speculation, and a decline in consumer spending. The crash led to a panic among investors, who rushed to sell their shares, which caused stock prices to plummet.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The decline in stock prices had a ripple effect throughout the economy. Many businesses were forced to close, and unemployment rose sharply. This, in turn, led to a wave of bank failures, as businesses and individuals were unable to repay their loans. As banks began to fail, depositors rushed to withdraw their money, which led to a shortage of cash reserves and further bank failures.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;To address the crisis, the US government and the Federal Reserve System implemented a number of measures. The government passed a series of laws aimed at regulating the banking system and restoring confidence in the financial system. The Federal Reserve System implemented a number of monetary policies aimed at increasing the money supply and lowering interest rates.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;However, these measures were not enough to stop the crisis from continuing. The crisis persisted until the late 1930s, when the US government began implementing a series of New Deal programs aimed at stimulating the economy and creating jobs.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;In conclusion, the 1929-1932 banking crisis was caused by a combination of factors, including overexpansion of credit, a speculative boom in the stock market, and a decline in consumer spending. The crisis led to a wave of bank failures, which contributed to a sharp rise in unemployment and a decline in economic activity. The crisis was addressed by a combination of government regulation and monetary policy, but it persisted until the late 1930s, when the US government began implementing a series of New Deal programs. The crisis had a profound impact on the US economy and the world, and it led to significant changes in the way that governments and central banks approached economic policy.

Now that we know about the Banking crisis of the Great Depression with the help of our AI friend. Let’s look at technicals, shall we? Don't be scared.

I am sure many guys on Twitter or Reddit or Youtube have already bored you with this pattern which totally looks like a period from 2000-2022. But these folks have no clue how to use it. Allow me to show you how. Just like the prev pattern we had a -46.20% drop for recession. The reason we had the drop this much was due to the fact that it was a gigantic super-bubble. That’s why it was 2x amplified. So you have to divide everything by 2. Hence 23.10% seems fair for a drop till 200wMA i.e a recessionary drop. Then again we had a rally up which btw in the textbook is called back to normal. It was only a few months later that we realized “oh uh” there is going to be a banking crisis on top of it. Hence the stock market came to test 200wMA a second time. Just like prev 1907 times the MA acted like quicksand. Hence initiated the financial crisis drop on top of it in wave 5. The overall drop had to be -45 to -50% but it was amplified by a factor of 2 hence the drop was almost -90%.

Theory : 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The 2008 banking crisis, also known as the Global Financial Crisis, was a severe economic downturn that began in the United States and quickly spread throughout the world. The crisis was triggered by a number of factors, including the subprime mortgage crisis, the securitization of mortgages, and the use of complex financial instruments.  
&gt;  
&gt;The subprime mortgage crisis was caused by the widespread issuance of subprime mortgages to borrowers who were unlikely to be able to repay them. These mortgages were then packaged together and sold as securities to investors, many of whom were not aware of the risks involved. When many of these borrowers defaulted on their loans, the value of these securities plummeted, which led to a crisis in the financial markets.  
&gt;  
&gt;The securitization of mortgages and the use of complex financial instruments, such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and credit default swaps (CDSs), also contributed to the crisis. These instruments were used to spread the risk of default across multiple parties, but they were often poorly understood and underregulated, which led to a systemic breakdown in the financial system.  
&gt;  
&gt;The crisis began in the US housing market but quickly spread to other parts of the economy. Many large financial institutions, including Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, and AIG, were heavily exposed to these complex financial instruments and suffered massive losses as a result. As these institutions began to fail, there was a panic among investors and depositors, which led to a shortage of liquidity in the financial system.  
&gt;  
&gt;To address the crisis, the US government and other governments around the world implemented a number of measures. The US government passed the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which provided funds to troubled financial institutions in exchange for equity stakes. The Federal Reserve System implemented a number of monetary policies aimed at increasing the money supply and stabilizing the financial system. Central banks around the world also implemented similar measures.  
&gt;  
&gt;The crisis had a profound impact on the global economy, and many countries experienced a sharp decline in economic activity and a rise in unemployment. The crisis also led to significant changes in the regulatory landscape, with many governments implementing stricter regulations on financial institutions and complex financial instruments.  
&gt;  
&gt;In conclusion, the 2008 banking crisis was caused by a combination of factors, including the subprime mortgage crisis, the securitization of mortgages, and the use of complex financial instruments. The crisis had a profound impact on the global economy and led to significant changes in the regulatory landscape. The crisis highlighted the need for better risk management and regulation in the financial sector, and it continues to have an impact on the way that governments and financial institutions approach economic policy.

It's the same thing happening over here and most of us have probably lived it when we were young. If you were not even born when this was happening I suggest kindly step out of the market. This analysis is just not meant for you 14yr olds.

2022 :  

&amp;#x200B;

Well, let's see how this turns out. But the one thing you guys can expect from this is that the bubble really is not in SPX and DJI. I have been saying this since last summer. It's the Nasdaq that needs to die. Yeah, tech buddies you guys need to go. Tech is a boom-bust cycle of 20yrs. You have to come to terms with this. You just cannot escape your fate. It's just like your crypto buddies who were not able to escape their 4yrs fate. So I humbly request you to kindly give up. You are just overloading the banking system.

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Conclusions** : 

The banking Crisis Recession can be categorized into 5 wave principles. No, I am not trying to do an Elliot wave here. So please advanced technical traders do not get confused.

&amp;#x200B;

Wave 1 : ( 200wMA I )

Recessionary drop.

&amp;#x200B;

Wave 2 :  ( Big Impulse I )

Impulse up i.e. Back to Normal.

&amp;#x200B;

Wave 3 : ( 200wMA II )

Confirmation signal for Banking Crisis coming where the quicksand happens and 200wMA acts like a magnet.

&amp;#x200B;

Wave 4 : ( Short Impulse II )

Small impulse up till 200wMA as resistance.

&amp;#x200B;

Wave 5 : ( Thee final Drop )

The Banking Crisis Unleashed.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

|S.No|Wave 1|Wave 2|Wave 3 |Wave 4|Wave 5|Overall|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1907|\-26.81%|\+12.78%|\-18.56%|\+6.70%|\-28.26%|\-48.54%|
|1929|\-49.40%|\+52.16%|\-30.11%|\+19.00%|\-83.59%|\-89.49%|
|2008|\-18.05%|\+12.91%|\-17.58%|\+9.60%|\-45.48%|\-54.43%|
|2022|\-22.44%|\+21.11%|?|?|?|?|
|(1907+2008) /2|\-22.43%||\-18.07%||\-36.87%||
|Average of three prev||||||\-64.15%|

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If we are expecting a banking crisis this year then the overall markets should drop greater than -45% but less than -64.15% ( average of three crashes). Do remember that the rough industry std is -50% but if I were to pick a random arbitrary number I would pick :

2022-23 overall DJI drop should be = -51.485% ( avg of 1907 and 2008 )

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Result :** 

This pattern will take time to activate. I can attach timestamps to it but I don’t think it would be necessary. All you have to understand is the wave-like price action 12345 and make your own decision on which wave you will trade. I cannot keep helping you guys. It’s about time you learn to catch fish yourself and stop complaining. Positional trading is not everyone’s cup of tea and it requires a lot of patience. Most people don’t have this.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Invalidation :** 

Every theory must have an invalidation. This is the one for me. What if we go up from here and only to crash later in Oct 2008? ( Hint: Quadruple Witching of March, Sept Low Liquidity attack which Fed still doesn't understand. )

People who read my past posts : 

&amp;#x200B;

""Desmond you are a traitor. Why did you sell off $FAZ etf. We were going to crush banks with you. We trusted you man. How could you do this to us""

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah guys I am not interested in crushing banks and hence took profits. I have told you all this before it is my personal vendetta and hence it shouldn't be yours. The question you should be asking is why is SPX short low. Well, folks, I wanted to reduce my position to get a better avg price so that any rallies that may come will be faded using that cash balance. As for bonds yah I sold them to buy more JD, 3x Chinese etf, and some gold miners' stocks. Overall my short position must be in the range of 50-60% now. I haven't calculated it coz I am writing this letter way fast.

P.s. Rumors are circulating around that your trading brokers may go insolvent Ex : Schwab, Robinhood, TD, etc. Now I don't know the full truth about it but I would advise you guys to not go all in with your savings in any broker. When the banking crisis hit you have no idea who is underwater and playing with customers' deposits. Let's just be clear it's just a rumor I heard on Twitter and no way i can prove it.

&amp;#x200B;

Important message :

Many new people don't know that I started this portfolio with $100 in Wall Street Newsletter in the hopes I will turn it into $10,000 in no time without using any options. So basically by predicting all bear market rallies with you guys, it grew $430+. I wish I had access to the US options market but I just don't.

**Closing thoughts :** 

No one really knows what is going to happen. If someone really knows what will happen please do comments down below. I really wanna know your theory going up for 2023. 

But today i am going to tell you a story and maybe you can draw some lessons from it. So the thing is my sister is at a medical university who paid x amt of money until the completion of her 4yrs. The authorities over there are now telling students to pay an additional same x amt more fees during their final internship phase otherwise they would not receive their medical degree. ( Maybe they are underwater in the financial market as well xD ) The message I wanted to convey to you guys from this story is that fraud, corruption and all sorts of dirty things are going to start happening from this yr. You thought scam comments in Yt, Twitter, and Discord were bad you guys have no idea what's in the store. So be vigilant in making any sort of financial decisions. Everyone out there is there to get you when the real austerity begins. If you haven't experienced the ""Legitimate things turning fraud cycle"" yourself then you might not be ready for this.

**Acknowledgment:** 

&amp;#x200B;

I would be lying if I said I have never watched any finance experts in my life. So I would like to thank some people who have been really helpful with their research in helping me throughout my finance journey. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Mike Wilson: Thank you for taking one for the team. Without you capitulating this would have not been possible sir. You really are the best tactical trader that I have ever seen on Bloomberg.
* Katie Stockton: Thanks for always shorting SPX above $3900 since Nov 2nd week. Also thanks to your friend Liss. You two are really the best folks to watch on Cnbc.
* Market Makers: Thank you, sir. I learned some advanced technical from you. These DW kind of indicators really helps me a lot when I try to put my macroeconomic research on top of it.
* Inthemoney: Thank you, man. You have taught people like us trading options and I wish I had taken the advice you gave me personally that the market can go sideways. Learned that the hard way. xD
* Maverick of Wall Street: Thank you for staying in the Stagflation camp man. It was really lonely when everyone was talking about disinflation. Even I panicked and had to hedge using bonds and the funny thing is I still do. Your jokes in the morning really make my day.
* All in Podcast &amp; Weekly startups: If you guys haven’t watched it you sure as hell are missing a lot. No words are enough to describe how awesome these podcasts are. Whatever discussion these guys have becomes the talk of the town for next week. 
* Block works Macro: The lineup these guys come up with is really mind-blowing. My fav ones have always been Lyn, Joseph, and Howell. The hosts of this show are equally amazing as well.
* Meet Kevin: Regardless of what anyone says he is still the most hardworking guy I have ever seen on Yt. The work ethic Kevin has is simply so hard for anyone to match. If you are looking for a daily macro research topic he is the guy to follow.
* Also thanks to the anonymous experienced investors who always try to give me advice like having a backup plan, invalidation cases, and not catching fish for others
* And thank you to everyone from Reddit and Twitter who has ever traded with me. Without you guys, this journey would not have been so successful. I know season 2 sucked in comparison to season 1 just like any other tv show from its highs. I will definitely try to improve more in next season 3 which releases in 2028 or maybe 2029. 
* Last and finally I would like to thank all the Legendary Investors in our space. Without your interviews on YT about finance I would have never learned anything. It's because of you folks that I am always calm and composed while i am investing or trading.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess this is how a goodbye feels like. Sayonara Everyone. We will soon meet again in 2028-29.

LONDON — HSBC on Monday announced a deal to buy the U.K. subsidiary of collapsed U.S. tech startup lender Silicon Valley Bank, following all-night talks.

HSBC confirmed that its U.K. ring-fenced subsidiary, HSBC UK Bank, had agreed to acquire SVB U.K. for £1 ($1.21). The assets and liabilities of SVB U.K.’s parent company are excluded from the transaction.

The acquisition “strengthens our commercial banking franchise and enhances our ability to serve innovative and fast-growing firms, including in the technology and life-science sectors, in the U.K. and internationally,” said HSBC Group CEO Noel Quinn.

“SVB U.K. customers can continue to bank as usual, safe in the knowledge that their deposits are backed by the strength, safety and security of HSBC.”

As of Friday, SVB U.K. had loans of around £5.5 billion and deposits of around £6.7 billion, with £88 million of full-year profit before tax in 2022, HSBC highlighted in the Monday statement. The bank expects SVB U.K.’s tangible equity to be around £1.4 billion, but added that “final calculation of the gain arising from the acquisition will be provided in due course.”

The sale, facilitated by the Bank of England in consultation with the U.K. Treasury, will protect the deposits of SVB U.K. clients, the Treasury said in a statement.

Shares of HSBC were down 3.4% around 9:30 a.m. London time, following the announcement of the transaction.

British Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt stressed that the deal “ensures customer deposits are protected and can bank as normal, with no taxpayer support.”

“The U.K.’s tech sector is genuinely world-leading and of huge importance to the British economy, supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs,” he added.

Hunt had on Sunday said that the U.K. administration and the Bank of England were working to “avoid or minimize” potential damage resulting from the U.K. branch of SVB.

In parallel, U.S. regulators on Sunday approved plans to backstop depositors and financial institutions linked with U.S. parent company SVB.

The U.S. Treasury Department designated both SVB and New York-based Signature Bank, which was shuttered Sunday over similar contagion fears, as systemic risks, enabling it to unwind both institutions in a way that protects depositors.

Toby Mather, CEO and co-founder of startup children’s education platform Lingumi, has been a customer of SVB for the last seven years, depositing 85% of the company’s cash with the stricken lender.

He told CNBC on Monday that the HSBC acquisition caused a “big sigh of relief” for British startups.

“I think I speak on behalf of UK startups when we say this is a huge relief and we can look our teams in the eye at 9 o’clock in our all-hands calls, which were going to be pretty nerve-racking this morning and say, not only will we be able to make the next payroll, but we can continue business as usual, continue innovating, doing our research and development and building the future of U.K. technology growth,” he said.

“HSBC is a great outcome … for the bank to go to a really large household name that has hundreds of years of history, I think is one of the best outcomes we could have had to feel like we can now stay with the new SVB, which has been such an important partner to the startup ecosystem, here and in the U.S. for decades now, so we feel confident.”

A host of potential buyers had submitted proposals to purchase SVB U.K. since the Friday failure of its U.S. parent company, amid widespread concern over the immediate futures of many British tech and life sciences startups.

The Bank of London said that a consortium of private equity firms that it led had also submitted a formal proposal to the U.K. Treasury and the Prudential Regulation Authority at the Bank of England.

Bank of London CEO Anthony Watson said SVB “cannot be allowed to fail given the vital community it serves.”

“This is a unique opportunity to ensure the U.K. has a more diversified banking sector, whilst allowing continuity of service to SVB’s U.K. client base. It would be deeply disappointing for this moment to lead to further consolidation of power among big banks.”

The Bank of England confirmed that no other U.K. banks are “directly materially affected by these actions, or by the resolution of SVBUK’s U.S. parent bank,” adding that the wider British banking system remains “safe, sound and well capitalised.”",138,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11q6oqw/hsbc_pays_1_to_rescue_uk_arm_of_silicon_valley/,"HSBC pays £1 to rescue UK arm of Silicon Valley Bank after all-night talks https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/13/hsbc-buys-silicon-valley-bank-uk-protecting-deposits-.html

LONDON — HSBC on Monday announced a deal to buy the U.K. subsidiary of collapsed U.S. tech startup lender Silicon Valley Bank, following all-night talks.

HSBC confirmed that its U.K. ring-fenced subsidiary, HSBC UK Bank, had agreed to acquire SVB U.K. for £1 ($1.21). The assets and liabilities of SVB U.K.’s parent company are excluded from the transaction.

The acquisition “strengthens our commercial banking franchise and enhances our ability to serve innovative and fast-growing firms, including in the technology and life-science sectors, in the U.K. and internationally,” said HSBC Group CEO Noel Quinn.

“SVB U.K. customers can continue to bank as usual, safe in the knowledge that their deposits are backed by the strength, safety and security of HSBC.”

As of Friday, SVB U.K. had loans of around £5.5 billion and deposits of around £6.7 billion, with £88 million of full-year profit before tax in 2022, HSBC highlighted in the Monday statement. The bank expects SVB U.K.’s tangible equity to be around £1.4 billion, but added that “final calculation of the gain arising from the acquisition will be provided in due course.”

The sale, facilitated by the Bank of England in consultation with the U.K. Treasury, will protect the deposits of SVB U.K. clients, the Treasury said in a statement.

Shares of HSBC were down 3.4% around 9:30 a.m. London time, following the announcement of the transaction.

I have a 2 year use horizon for my funds (grad school) and could not stomach a 15k drop in them if the situation started to deteriorate further. Am I an idiot for pulling out? I feel like I should have never put that money in to begin with. Granted i am only 3% down I just feel like it should have been in treasuries anyway given the horizon and how risk averse I am to losing it.

Edit: Because I am getting absolutely massacred in the comments here, this was my thinking:

I invested the funds a year and a half ago and grew the portfolio significantly. At that time, I figured at 24 if I didn’t go to school I’d just build a little nest egg for retirement on the side through general market etfs. Then the rate hike cycle began. I figured hey, so long as earnings remain unaffected I might as well just keep buying dips and hold 50% of my grad school funds on the side in case a huge dip/buying opportunity occurred.

This morning, even more Friday honestly, I realized I am a f-ing moron. Why tf am I subjecting myself to this volatility over a 2 year horizon? Yeah of course, I’m 20 years I’ll be well in the green but I have no idea at all if the market trades sideways, tanks, whatever over the next two years. I personally felt that the overwhelming negative sentiment makes equities pointless to own over the short term when u have a viable guaranteed 5% yield in the background.

The FHLB system, a key source of cash for regional lenders, is seeking to raise about $64 billion through the sale of short-term notes, according to people with knowledge of the matter. 

“This isn’t the normal size for sure but likely reflects bank funding needs given the backdrop,” said Ian Burdette, head of term rates trading at Academy Securities. “I don’t think they’d be doing what they’re doing if there wasn’t real bank demand.”

The system of 11 regional banks is a Depression-era backstop that private banks can use for short-term funding without the stigma of taking money from the Federal Reserve. It’s widely seen as a safety net and has been called the “lender of next-to-last resort” — a play on the nickname for the Fed’s famed discount window. 

The five-part offering of floating-rate notes is being led by Barclays Plc, Nomura Holdings Inc., Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and Citigroup Inc. Due to the sheer target size of $64 billion that the agency is looking to raise, the the note offering will be syndicated. Typically these short-term agency trades are sold via reverse inquiry, meaning customers would go to the website and put their order through and get some or part of their request filled. But because of the size of this deal, a syndicate group was formed to appeal to a wider investor base.

The bond sale signals banks are going to continue tapping their lines with the FHLB system this week, ahead of possible contagion fears after Silicon Valley Bank on Friday became the biggest US bank collapse since the 2008 financial crisis. Venture capital firms and individuals rushed to get their money out of the California-based institution late last week, setting off one of the largest bank runs in a decade and hitting a wide variety of businesses, from startups to vineyard owners. 

As a result, regional banks’ stocks plummeted on Friday and continue dropping Monday as investors tried to reduce exposure to the industry.

The rapid selloff comes even as the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said they were introducing a new backstop for banks that would be large enough to protect the entire nation’s deposits. Investors poured money into safe assets like US Treasuries and gold on Monday, and a series of companies scrapped their plans to sell high-grade corporate bonds. 

Academy’s Burdette said the banks may be opting to tap the FHLBs because it’s “the path of least resistance” given the newness of the Fed’s Bank Term Funding Program.

Well, it happens that the biggest shareholders were indexers and ETF builders trying to match the S&amp;P 500 Composite and other indexes:  Vanguard, Blackrock and State Street.  Together, they used to hold $1.5 billion of SIVB shares before the price drop.

However, there were some buyside entities that were left holding the bag.  The largest discretionary holders of SIVB were (1) Swedish pension fund Alecta Pensionsforsakring, Omsesidigt, (2) Artisan Partners Limited Partnership and (3) Geode Capital Management, LLC (Fidelity's spin-off).  Together, they held shares worth $600-$700 million before the wipe out.

Discretionary here meaning they actively decided to invest in SIVB based on its merit, not passively by virtue of its inclusion in the S&amp;P 500.  So if these shareholders are wiped out, are they materially hurt as going concerns?  Strongly doubt Vanguard, State Street and Blackrock are as they are large entities.  But what about the Swedish pension fund and a few other ones -- remember here that they are not exactly coming out and crying foul yet since they would be derided as ""incompetent"" in deciding to invest in SIVB.  Presumably these buyside firms held SIVB as part of a diversified portfolio.  But stories usually come out later regarding the wipe-out, equivalent to an S&amp;P 500 component going abruptly bankrupt -- which is very rare.

The point here is that some portfolio managers still saw value in SIVB.  They did not foresee 3 things which, in combination, caused SIVB's collapse: (1) the duration mismatch resulting in large unrealized losses; (2) the withdrawal of deposit amounts in favor of US Treasuries due to the Fed rapidly raising rates; and (3) the subsequent run on the bank exacerbated by the announcement of a failed secondary offering to meet cash needs.

11qgq49,2023-03-13 18:03:18,stocks,deus_explatypus,How SVB got wrecked by a concept that all first-year economics students are taught — bond yields and seasonal cash flow patterns,"Bonds 101: investors expect higher rates on longer term bonds due to higher risk exposure and effects of inflation. 
  
Inversion: when the market expects interest rates to rise in the near future, long term return ls can be lower than shorter term bonds. 

From [investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/invertedyieldcurve.asp): As of Dec. 2, 2022, Treasury yields were as follows, the most recent flip to an inverted curve:

Three-month Treasury yield: 4.22%
Two-year Treasury yield: 4.28%
10-year Treasury yield: 3.51%
30-year Treasury yield: 3.56%

So, since at least early December last year, the market has been on alert that interest rates would likely be rising. The Fed has been clear with its plan to hike rates since at least early 2022. 
  
And yet, here was SVB, apparently sitting on a massive number of treasury securities with low rates originating from the insane quantitative easing of post-covid Fed policy with no plans on how to hedge knowing full well their bonds would lose significant value. 
  
But why did this happen now if the rest of the world has known about rate hikes since early/mid 2022? Surely the professionals and seasoned finance executives are well attuned to market risks and fluctuations. 
  
Seasonal liquidity crunches. It was the nail in the coffin for SVB. And they are not a new phenomena. Consider that talk of rate hikes and recession began towards the end of Q3 2022, and SVBs collapse occurred in corresponding the two-week period before the end of Q1. What other notable crises happened around these periods?
  
- [March 16th, 2008](https://www.thebalancemoney.com/bearn-stearns-collapse-and-bailout-3305613): Bear Sterns announces sale to Chase
  
- [September 15th, 2008](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_Lehman_Brothers): Lehman brothers declares bankruptcy
  
-[September 16, 2008](https://www.thebalancemoney.com/aig-bailout-cost-timeline-bonuses-causes-effects-3305693): AIG received $85bn bailout by the Fed. We all know how that went. 
  
- [Black Monday](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_stock_market_crash), March 9-22, 2020: when the market saw its worst days during the beginning of the Covid crisis. 
  
These quarter closes are not perfect indicators, there is nothing magical about the weeks leading up to quarter close that indicates a crisis will occur, but they suggest something about our global monetary system that in inherently unstable leading up to these periods, and has been since at least 2007-08.

But, this was a black swan event, you say, bank runs are impossible to predict and we had no way of knowing this would happen. Let me give you an idea of who led SVB into this crisis:
  
1.	⁠CEO: Director at San Francisco Fed
2.	⁠CFO: Former analyst at Freddie Mac
3.	⁠Chief Admin Officer: Former CFO of Lehman Brothers
4.	⁠Chief Risk Officer: Led credit ratings in 2007
5.	⁠Chief Legal Officer: General Counsel at Citibank in 2008

These are the same people who oversaw the 2008 recession. I don’t want to pretend like all of these individuals arent criminals, they are. They just also happen to be incompetent. 
  
The warning signs were there in 2022 but just like in 07-08, those in charge refused to do anything that would jeopardize corporate profits. 
  
But they did see something. The SVB c-suite [sold large portions of stock in the run up](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=719739&amp;owner=exclude), this is not a coincidence: 
  
- Gregory Becker, CEO, sold 11% on Feb 27, 2023.
- Michael Zucker, General Counsel, 19% on Feb 5.
- Daniel Beck, CFO, sold 32% on Feb 27.
- Michelle Draper, CMO, sold 25% on Feb 1.
  
The bottom line: CEOs and their firms treat the monetary system like a casino. But the system is sick. It can’t sustain the level of greed and growth that those at the top demand of it. It’s unsustainable and everyone knows it now. We could see more collapse in six months, or we could continue to limp along for another decade or so like after 2008. Regardless of the result, I guarantee nothing will change.",674,94,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11qgq49/how_svb_got_wrecked_by_a_concept_that_all/,"How SVB got wrecked by a concept that all first-year economics students are taught — bond yields and seasonal cash flow patterns Bonds 101: investors expect higher rates on longer term bonds due to higher risk exposure and effects of inflation. 
  
Inversion: when the market expects interest rates to rise in the near future, long term return ls can be lower than shorter term bonds. 

From [investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/invertedyieldcurve.asp): As of Dec. 2, 2022, Treasury yields were as follows, the most recent flip to an inverted curve:

Three-month Treasury yield: 4.22%
Two-year Treasury yield: 4.28%
10-year Treasury yield: 3.51%
30-year Treasury yield: 3.56%

So, since at least early December last year, the market has been on alert that interest rates would likely be rising. The Fed has been clear with its plan to hike rates since at least early 2022. 
  
And yet, here was SVB, apparently sitting on a massive number of treasury securities with low rates originating from the insane quantitative easing of post-covid Fed policy with no plans on how to hedge knowing full well their bonds would lose significant value. 
  
But why did this happen now if the rest of the world has known about rate hikes since early/mid 2022? Surely the professionals and seasoned finance executives are well attuned to market risks and fluctuations. 
  
Seasonal liquidity crunches. It was the nail in the coffin for SVB. And they are not a new phenomena. Consider that talk of rate hikes and recession began towards the end of Q3 2022, and SVBs collapse occurred in corresponding the two-week period before the end of Q1. What other notable crises happened around these periods?
  
- [March 16th, 2008](https://www.thebalancemoney.com/bearn-stearns-collapse-and-bailout-3305613): Bear Sterns announces sale to Chase
  
- [September 15th, 2008](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_Lehman_Brothers): Lehman brothers declares bankruptcy
  
-[September 16, 2008](https://www.thebalancemoney.com/aig-bailout-cost-timeline-bonuses-causes-effects-3305693): AIG received $85bn bailout by the Fed. We all know how that went. 
  
- [Black Monday](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_stock_market_crash), March 9-22, 2020: when the market saw its worst days during the beginning of the Covid crisis. 
  
These quarter closes are not perfect indicators, there is nothing magical about the weeks leading up to quarter close that indicates a crisis will occur, but they suggest something about our global monetary system that in inherently unstable leading up to these periods, and has been since at least 2007-08.

But, this was a black swan event, you say, bank runs are impossible to predict and we had no way of knowing this would happen. Let me give you an idea of who led SVB into this crisis:
  
1.	⁠CEO: Director at San Francisco Fed
2.	⁠CFO: Former analyst at Freddie Mac
3.	⁠Chief Admin Officer: Former CFO of Lehman Brothers
4.	⁠Chief Risk Officer: Led credit ratings in 2007
5.	⁠Chief Legal Officer: General Counsel at Citibank in 2008

These are the same people who oversaw the 2008 recession. I don’t want to pretend like all of these individuals arent criminals, they are. They just also happen to be incompetent. 
  
The warning signs were there in 2022 but just like in 07-08, those in charge refused to do anything that would jeopardize corporate profits. 
  
But they did see something. The SVB c-suite [sold large portions of stock in the run up](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=719739&amp;owner=exclude), this is not a coincidence: 
  
- Gregory Becker, CEO, sold 11% on Feb 27, 2023.
- Michael Zucker, General Counsel, 19% on Feb 5.
- Daniel Beck, CFO, sold 32% on Feb 27.
- Michelle Draper, CMO, sold 25% on Feb 1.
  
The bottom line: CEOs and their firms treat the monetary system like a casino. But the system is sick. It can’t sustain the level of greed and growth that those at the top demand of it. It’s unsustainable and everyone knows it now. We could see more collapse in six months, or we could continue to limp along for another decade or so like after 2008. Regardless of the result, I guarantee nothing will change."

https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/13/hsbc-buys-silicon-valley-bank-uk-protecting-deposits-.html

LONDON — HSBC on Monday announced a deal to buy the U.K. subsidiary of collapsed U.S. tech startup lender Silicon Valley Bank, following all-night talks.

HSBC confirmed that its U.K. ring-fenced subsidiary, HSBC UK Bank, had agreed to acquire SVB U.K. for £1 ($1.21). The assets and liabilities of SVB U.K.’s parent company are excluded from the transaction.

The acquisition “strengthens our commercial banking franchise and enhances our ability to serve innovative and fast-growing firms, including in the technology and life-science sectors, in the U.K. and internationally,” said HSBC Group CEO Noel Quinn.

“SVB U.K. customers can continue to bank as usual, safe in the knowledge that their deposits are backed by the strength, safety and security of HSBC.”

As of Friday, SVB U.K. had loans of around £5.5 billion and deposits of around £6.7 billion, with £88 million of full-year profit before tax in 2022, HSBC highlighted in the Monday statement. The bank expects SVB U.K.’s tangible equity to be around £1.4 billion, but added that “final calculation of the gain arising from the acquisition will be provided in due course.”

The sale, facilitated by the Bank of England in consultation with the U.K. Treasury, will protect the deposits of SVB U.K. clients, the Treasury said in a statement.

Shares of HSBC were down 3.4% around 9:30 a.m. London time, following the announcement of the transaction.

British Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt stressed that the deal “ensures customer deposits are protected and can bank as normal, with no taxpayer support.”

“The U.K.’s tech sector is genuinely world-leading and of huge importance to the British economy, supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs,” he added.

Hunt had on Sunday said that the U.K. administration and the Bank of England were working to “avoid or minimize” potential damage resulting from the U.K. branch of SVB.

In parallel, U.S. regulators on Sunday approved plans to backstop depositors and financial institutions linked with U.S. parent company SVB.

The U.S. Treasury Department designated both SVB and New York-based Signature Bank, which was shuttered Sunday over similar contagion fears, as systemic risks, enabling it to unwind both institutions in a way that protects depositors.

Toby Mather, CEO and co-founder of startup children’s education platform Lingumi, has been a customer of SVB for the last seven years, depositing 85% of the company’s cash with the stricken lender.

He told CNBC on Monday that the HSBC acquisition caused a “big sigh of relief” for British startups.

“I think I speak on behalf of UK startups when we say this is a huge relief and we can look our teams in the eye at 9 o’clock in our all-hands calls, which were going to be pretty nerve-racking this morning and say, not only will we be able to make the next payroll, but we can continue business as usual, continue innovating, doing our research and development and building the future of U.K. technology growth,” he said.

“HSBC is a great outcome … for the bank to go to a really large household name that has hundreds of years of history, I think is one of the best outcomes we could have had to feel like we can now stay with the new SVB, which has been such an important partner to the startup ecosystem, here and in the U.S. for decades now, so we feel confident.”

A host of potential buyers had submitted proposals to purchase SVB U.K. since the Friday failure of its U.S. parent company, amid widespread concern over the immediate futures of many British tech and life sciences startups.

The Bank of London said that a consortium of private equity firms that it led had also submitted a formal proposal to the U.K. Treasury and the Prudential Regulation Authority at the Bank of England.

Bank of London CEO Anthony Watson said SVB “cannot be allowed to fail given the vital community it serves.”

“This is a unique opportunity to ensure the U.K. has a more diversified banking sector, whilst allowing continuity of service to SVB’s U.K. client base. It would be deeply disappointing for this moment to lead to further consolidation of power among big banks.”

The Bank of England confirmed that no other U.K. banks are “directly materially affected by these actions, or by the resolution of SVBUK’s U.S. parent bank,” adding that the wider British banking system remains “safe, sound and well capitalised.”",30,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11qnrik/hsbc_pays_1_to_rescue_uk_arm_of_silicon_valley/,"HSBC pays £1 to rescue UK arm of Silicon Valley Bank after all-night talks

The acquisition “strengthens our commercial banking franchise and enhances our ability to serve innovative and fast-growing firms, including in the technology and life-science sectors, in the U.K. and internationally,” said HSBC Group CEO Noel Quinn.

“SVB U.K. customers can continue to bank as usual, safe in the knowledge that their deposits are backed by the strength, safety and security of HSBC.”

As of Friday, SVB U.K. had loans of around £5.5 billion and deposits of around £6.7 billion, with £88 million of full-year profit before tax in 2022, HSBC highlighted in the Monday statement. The bank expects SVB U.K.’s tangible equity to be around £1.4 billion, but added that “final calculation of the gain arising from the acquisition will be provided in due course.”

The sale, facilitated by the Bank of England in consultation with the U.K. Treasury, will protect the deposits of SVB U.K. clients, the Treasury said in a statement.

Shares of HSBC were down 3.4% around 9:30 a.m. London time, following the announcement of the transaction.

British Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt stressed that the deal “ensures customer deposits are protected and can bank as normal, with no taxpayer support.”

“The U.K.’s tech sector is genuinely world-leading and of huge importance to the British economy, supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs,” he added.

Hunt had on Sunday said that the U.K. administration and the Bank of England were working to “avoid or minimize” potential damage resulting from the U.K. branch of SVB.

In parallel, U.S. regulators on Sunday approved plans to backstop depositors and financial institutions linked with U.S. parent company SVB.

The U.S. Treasury Department designated both SVB and New York-based Signature Bank, which was shuttered Sunday over similar contagion fears, as systemic risks, enabling it to unwind both institutions in a way that protects depositors.

Toby Mather, CEO and co-founder of startup children’s education platform Lingumi, has been a customer of SVB for the last seven years, depositing 85% of the company’s cash with the stricken lender.

He told CNBC on Monday that the HSBC acquisition caused a “big sigh of relief” for British startups.

“I think I speak on behalf of UK startups when we say this is a huge relief and we can look our teams in the eye at 9 o’clock in our all-hands calls, which were going to be pretty nerve-racking this morning and say, not only will we be able to make the next payroll, but we can continue business as usual, continue innovating, doing our research and development and building the future of U.K. technology growth,” he said.

“HSBC is a great outcome … for the bank to go to a really large household name that has hundreds of years of history, I think is one of the best outcomes we could have had to feel like we can now stay with the new SVB, which has been such an important partner to the startup ecosystem, here and in the U.S. for decades now, so we feel confident.”

A host of potential buyers had submitted proposals to purchase SVB U.K. since the Friday failure of its U.S. parent company, amid widespread concern over the immediate futures of many British tech and life sciences startups.

The Bank of London said that a consortium of private equity firms that it led had also submitted a formal proposal to the U.K. Treasury and the Prudential Regulation Authority at the Bank of England.

Bank of London CEO Anthony Watson said SVB “cannot be allowed to fail given the vital community it serves.”

“This is a unique opportunity to ensure the U.K. has a more diversified banking sector, whilst allowing continuity of service to SVB’s U.K. client base. It would be deeply disappointing for this moment to lead to further consolidation of power among big banks.”

The Bank of England confirmed that no other U.K. banks are “directly materially affected by these actions, or by the resolution of SVBUK’s U.S. parent bank,” adding that the wider British banking system remains “safe, sound and well capitalised.”"

Based on my estimations here is what the numbers say and what i predict...  


CPI YoY: numbers call for 6-6.2%... I believe we will see a 6% CPI YOY

my thoughts are this and really has been this for a while... however, the bank run made me size down alot for this play but in a way also helped me... but i believe what is going to happen is the above extremely bullish print on CPI. When this happens with the bank run which has now already priced in a 32.1% chance of a 0bps hike at the next FOMC meeting (next wednesday the 22nd).... we are about to see a massive breakout. I dont know if we get the type of run we got in november with that incredible 5% green day... but i think this is setting up for a massive not only green day but a massive run into FOMC...  


think about this... CPI is pretty much the last key piece of data the fed will get before FOMC next week. We have PPI on wednesday but should be a nothing burger... SO if CPI is the last piece of important data then when they see this bullish print we are going to get an incredible green open. We have basically had 2 opens in a row on CPI that didnt do anything and burnt everyone. The MM has convinced people to stop playing CPI and more importantly stopped people from playing straddles now... we are overdue for a massive reaction.   


cooler cpi opens us into a huge rally... the chances of a 0bps is going to go to about 80%+ when we get those numbers. that 0bps is going to force a huge rally. what this bank run did is actually push the fed to go faster than they would probably want to with cutting rates. 

its like they always say... the feds gonna hike until something breaks...   


My ultimate target for tomorrow is 405.17... thats a MASSIVE level to watch and is almost our upside daily supply (resistance) to watch... i think we could easily open 3%+ tomorrow IF the numbers come in as good as i expect.... If you think about it after this bank run nonsense algos are ready to burn everyone that jumped heavily into puts last week and today.

Now if im wrong and we get a hot af cpi then we easily are going to see a 25bps 100% priced back in and most likely open -3% and i would be targeting the 373.98 demand (support).   


either way tomorrow is going to be extreme volatile.

IF my calculations are correct and IF we get the standard IV pump of 80-100% and we open at 1% that would be about 400% gainer, if we open at least 2% green this should be at least a 1000% gainer... if we open 3%+ (like November) it should be about a 2600% gainer...   


If we open red... well TOS just got a $315 donation to hopefully prevent them from going bankrupt during this bank run so i dont have to switch brokers... Either way i only risked todays profits i have ALWAYS wanted to on a day like today buy the ""end"" of the options chain.

Here is how.,"The recent news of brokers asking customers if they want to turn on lending gives much more credence to the fact that if you have lending disabled, your shares will not be lent out.

Cash accounts are required BY LAW to obtain your written permission for share lending because lent out shares ARE NOT COVERED by SIPC
Insurance. If you do that, it is like giving up your FDIC insurance on your bank account during a bank run. This also makes it YOUR Responsibility to make sure it is turned off.

This is another reason to trust that if you have lending turned off the chances of short sellers being able to borrow them is slim. A broker would have to be pretty dumb to advertise they are SIPC insured and then lend out your shares while many banks are collapsing.

HOWEVER:
Many brokers will enroll you by default and you have to OPT OUT or they will ask you during the signup process if you want to enroll in their lending programs and you may have signed up by accident.

If you ACCIDENTLY or KNOWINGLY lent out your shares and the broker goes broke, you lose 100% of your investment because it is not SIPC insured.
Otherwise, you are covered up to $500k in case of losses.

11qqo2n,2023-03-14 00:07:46,wallstreetbets,sunfrost,What's next for the regional banks?,"As everyone has learned from the SVB case, most banks are stuck holding large unrealized losses on treasury portfolios.  

&amp;#x200B;

[Unrealized Losses](https://preview.redd.it/xap41x2tdlna1.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4a4f93dd28b0feae4cab8a040659a9263bb45d53)

Banks that run short of liquidity to redeem deposits need to sell their assets to generate liquidity or use the interbank lending market to secure short-term liquidity.  

SIVB's unrealized losses ballooned over recent quarters as rates continued to climb on treasury bills, notes and bonds:

&amp;#x200B;

[SIVB Losses](https://preview.redd.it/bmittbzeelna1.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b27ae881d83d57cd6bbba12dbe36bfa9183cc2bd)

All the banks are in similar boats, where depositor flight and a lack of liquidity are turning unrealized losses into realized losses.  Larger banks are less dependent on deposits as their source of assets, meaning they can weather the storm much longer than smaller more deposit-dependent banks.  

&amp;#x200B;

[Deposit dependence ](https://preview.redd.it/psa8rbpvelna1.jpg?width=1088&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d4e37320ad1f29488b1c7a01dc7861784c5a17c1)

With Sunday's and Monday's announcements of Treasury and FDIC backstopping deposit holders at SVB and other failed banks, but crucially NOT covering creditors and shareholders, the Treasury Department has moved the ""run"" on the banks from Main Street to Wall Street.  

There are many more regional banks at risk of closure and receivership.  Their typical means of generating liquidity through interbank lending has now frozen.  

[https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/market-stress-indicators-begin-flash-wake-svb-collapse-2023-03-13/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/market-stress-indicators-begin-flash-wake-svb-collapse-2023-03-13/)

&gt; The so-called FRA-OIS spread , which measures the gap between the U.S. three-month forward rate agreement and the overnight index swap rate, edged to its widest since Feb. 21, to 11.4 basis points. This spread is widely seen as a proxy for banking sector risk and a higher reading reflects rising interbank lending risk. 

As investors, secured creditors/lenders to regional banks are not protected, there is an onghoing pullback in the market whereby larger banks will opt to sell existing investments and discontinue their investments in regional bank debts and stocks.  This also occurs at the fund level where fund managers will sell their stocks for fear of bank failure and total loss.  

Furthermore, Regional banking operations also include bond sales, preferred share financing, and securitization.   Many of these regional banks will be unable to sell new issuance, as the investors risk a complete loss of capital if the bank is put into receivership.  All of this leads to increased pressure and more bank failures.  

The only other options for lenders are the primary and secondary lending facilities offered directly by the FED.  These may allow a lender access to liquidity for up to 90 days, financed with treasury collateral.  

[https://www.frbdiscountwindow.org/Pages/General-Information/Primary-and-Secondary-Lending-Programs.aspx](https://www.frbdiscountwindow.org/Pages/General-Information/Primary-and-Secondary-Lending-Programs.aspx)

Primary lending is available for ""non-troubled"" banks, with normal rates and less discount to collateral value, and secondary lending is available for troubled banks with higher rates and greater discounts to collateral values.  These facilities are only short term though and only postpone a liquidity crisis if the institution is unable to more deposits.  

Faced with selling pressure on their stocks and bonds, regional banks will continue to face funding pressure without a longer-term solution, or a substantial improvement in the price of treasuries (i.e. lower rates).  

As the regional banks fail, their assets are made available to the banking industry to bid on.  Offering large national banks the chance to buy balance sheets and deposits for a big discount.  National banks would rather buy closed banks at a discount, than lend to open banks that risk total loss of value if the bank later closes.  

What can the Fed and Treasury do in order to bring stability back, and preserve more regional banks?  

The Fed will be forced to offer one of the following, or both...

1. Fed-backed/protected interbank lending program
2. TARP-like program for treasuries with long terms and preferred lending rates

&amp;#x200B;

A Fed-backed lending protection program for the interbank lending market would unfreeze credit markets and help alleviate stress on regional banks while protecting shareholders, bondholders, and larger bank lenders.  

A TARP-like program for treasuries would allow regional banks to park unrealized losses with the fed for immediate liquidity in exchange for a REPO agreement that could be years in terms of duration.  This offloads the balance sheet losses to the fed in exchange for freely liquid capital, and the bank can repurchase the treasuries later when rates have fallen and the bank can sell in the open market without market losses.

&amp;#x200B;

Until one of these programs is established, expect regional banks to continue to be under substantial selling pressure, more failures, and an increasingly frozen interbank lending market.",46,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11qqo2n/whats_next_for_the_regional_banks/,"What's next for the regional banks? As everyone has learned from the SVB case, most banks are stuck holding large unrealized losses on treasury portfolios.  

&amp;#x200B;

[Unrealized Losses](https://preview.redd.it/xap41x2tdlna1.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4a4f93dd28b0feae4cab8a040659a9263bb45d53)

Banks that run short of liquidity to redeem deposits need to sell their assets to generate liquidity or use the interbank lending market to secure short-term liquidity.  

SIVB's unrealized losses ballooned over recent quarters as rates continued to climb on treasury bills, notes and bonds:

&amp;#x200B;

[SIVB Losses](https://preview.redd.it/bmittbzeelna1.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b27ae881d83d57cd6bbba12dbe36bfa9183cc2bd)

All the banks are in similar boats, where depositor flight and a lack of liquidity are turning unrealized losses into realized losses.  Larger banks are less dependent on deposits as their source of assets, meaning they can weather the storm much longer than smaller more deposit-dependent banks.  

&amp;#x200B;

[Deposit dependence ](https://preview.redd.it/psa8rbpvelna1.jpg?width=1088&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d4e37320ad1f29488b1c7a01dc7861784c5a17c1)

With Sunday's and Monday's announcements of Treasury and FDIC backstopping deposit holders at SVB and other failed banks, but crucially NOT covering creditors and shareholders, the Treasury Department has moved the ""run"" on the banks from Main Street to Wall Street.  

There are many more regional banks at risk of closure and receivership.  Their typical means of generating liquidity through interbank lending has now frozen.  

[https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/market-stress-indicators-begin-flash-wake-svb-collapse-2023-03-13/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/market-stress-indicators-begin-flash-wake-svb-collapse-2023-03-13/)

&gt; The so-called FRA-OIS spread , which measures the gap between the U.S. three-month forward rate agreement and the overnight index swap rate, edged to its widest since Feb. 21, to 11.4 basis points. This spread is widely seen as a proxy for banking sector risk and a higher reading reflects rising interbank lending risk. 

As investors, secured creditors/lenders to regional banks are not protected, there is an onghoing pullback in the market whereby larger banks will opt to sell existing investments and discontinue their investments in regional bank debts and stocks.  This also occurs at the fund level where fund managers will sell their stocks for fear of bank failure and total loss.  

Furthermore, Regional banking operations also include bond sales, preferred share financing, and securitization.   Many of these regional banks will be unable to sell new issuance, as the investors risk a complete loss of capital if the bank is put into receivership.  All of this leads to increased pressure and more bank failures.  

The only other options for lenders are the primary and secondary lending facilities offered directly by the FED.  These may allow a lender access to liquidity for up to 90 days, financed with treasury collateral.  

[https://www.frbdiscountwindow.org/Pages/General-Information/Primary-and-Secondary-Lending-Programs.aspx](https://www.frbdiscountwindow.org/Pages/General-Information/Primary-and-Secondary-Lending-Programs.aspx)

Primary lending is available for ""non-troubled"" banks, with normal rates and less discount to collateral value, and secondary lending is available for troubled banks with higher rates and greater discounts to collateral values.  These facilities are only short term though and only postpone a liquidity crisis if the institution is unable to more deposits.  

Faced with selling pressure on their stocks and bonds, regional banks will continue to face funding pressure without a longer-term solution, or a substantial improvement in the price of treasuries (i.e. lower rates).  

As the regional banks fail, their assets are made available to the banking industry to bid on.  Offering large national banks the chance to buy balance sheets and deposits for a big discount.  National banks would rather buy closed banks at a discount, than lend to open banks that risk total loss of value if the bank later closes.  

What can the Fed and Treasury do in order to bring stability back, and preserve more regional banks?  

The Fed will be forced to offer one of the following, or both...

1. Fed-backed/protected interbank lending program
2. TARP-like program for treasuries with long terms and preferred lending rates

A Fed-backed lending protection program for the interbank lending market would unfreeze credit markets and help alleviate stress on regional banks while protecting shareholders, bondholders, and larger bank lenders.

11qtd7o,2023-03-14 01:59:38,wallstreetbets,TraderBoy,How the FED can help BofA to stay afloat,"I had a long shower today thinking about what happened in the SVB saga and what it means for banks who will not default in this entire shitshow. And also what Yellen said about banks being well capitalised.

So essentially banks make their money by loaning money to ppl for a higher interest rate than they pay to their depositors. It makes the interest spread and covers their cost, meanwhile making a bit profit. However in the current regime, they actually buy bonds. Because why give a small business a bigger loan when you can buy securitised housing bonds? ;)

Now what happened to SVB is that some depositors moved monies away to buy bonds because they simply yield more. That triggered SVB to sell their HTM assets at 20% loss. You could also see it the following way: SVB did really bad bets in the market with 80% of their assets being invested in +10 years MBS bonds but that is fine. Because their dumbass depositors would usually stay and accept a 0% interest rate. Roku literally had 500mln of non-interest paying deposits there. Circle had 3.3bln. Why is that money just sitting there, not yielding anything?!

I had the pleasure and fun to look at some other banks. Lets have a look at the second biggest bank (BofA) because they just have such a more severe problem than JP Morgan. BofA have a paper HTM loss that is not in the balance sheet of 130bln again book equity of 240bln (vs JP Morgan of 49bln/290bln). 

[See the HTM 113bln, that is NOT in the balance sheet?! 5bln in AFS loss but that is in the balance sheet, although not the net income figure LOL](https://preview.redd.it/a8krzqgnplna1.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=de3e620f7f0546bd601e2b587598dc9245899cd1)

&amp;#x200B;

[Equity is 273bln... minus 113bln.... so the actual mark to market value of the book equity is 160bln](https://preview.redd.it/q6f774hiqlna1.png?width=2382&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=39add731210130c1b6ee096541784703c0831326)

Now is equity actually 160bln? No, BofA has acquired in the past other banks for way more $ than justified. But since they paid more, they just assume that “overpaid position” has an invisible, artificial value. Its called goodwill.

&amp;#x200B;

[Lets subtract from 160bln, 70bln = 90bln](https://preview.redd.it/48ixwoojslna1.png?width=2140&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=322c98db691daefa3b69540318064336e45eda0d)

So the effective MtM equity BofA has is just 90bln?! 

Which begs the question... how much is the remaining 90bln good for if rates continue to rise. Lets have a look at their bond assets.

&amp;#x200B;

[Nearly all the unreported HTM losses came from \&gt;10 years bonds which dropped in value from 509bln to 421bln.](https://preview.redd.it/8m7a7ohvwlna1.png?width=1938&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=91bdafd72e4f36a46277b555a767143263d376d1)

Lets assume the average MBS they hold is 20 years in maturity, we can use the bond duration to calculate that for every 0.5% interest increase, the book value of these assets will drop by 25bln for the entire HTM section. All of this of course not taking into account economic recessions and loan losses that have to be covered in such events. 

High interest rates are usually good for banks. They can make the full loan/deposit spread. But the speed the interest rates were raised is gonna break some necks out there.

&amp;#x200B;

So what is the FED gonna do? Raise rates &gt; 5% and let the effective equity of banks drop to 0?

No matter what, I don’t want to be long BofA. Market cap is still trading 230bln.

Inflation rose in February but was in line with expectations, providing a key input into whether the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates.

The consumer price index increased 0.4% for the month, putting the annual inflation rate at 6%, the Labor Department reported Tuesday. Both readings were exactly in line with Dow Jones estimates.

Excluding volatile food and energy prices, core CPI increased 0.5% in February and 5.5% on a 12-month basis. The monthly reading was slightly ahead of the 0.4% estimate, but the annual level was in line.

CPI measures a broad basket of goods and services and is one of several key measures the Fed uses when formulating monetary policy. The report along with Wednesday’s producer price index will be the last inflation-related data points policymakers will see before they meet March 21-22.

Heading into the release, markets had widely expected the Fed to approve another 0.25 percentage point increase to its benchmark federal funds rate.

However, banking sector turmoil in recent days has kindled speculation that the central bank could signal that it soon will halt the rate hikes as officials observe the impact that a series of tightening measures have had over the past year.

Markets Tuesday morning were pricing a peak, or terminal, rate of about 4.92%, which would mean the upcoming increase would be the last. Futures pricing is volatile, though, and unexpectedly strong inflation reports this week likely would cause a repricing.

Either way, market sentiment has shifted dramatically.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell last week told two congressional committees that the central bank is prepared to push rates higher than expected if inflation does not come down. That set off a wave of speculation that the Fed could be teeing up a 0.5 percentage point hike next week.

However, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank over the past several days paved the way for a more restrained view for monetary policy.",982,294,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11r516a/inflation_gauge_increased_04_in_february_as/,"Inflation gauge increased 0.4% in February, as expected and up 6% from a year ago https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/14/cpi-inflation-february-2023-.html

Here is a link to the working paper, published last month by the San Francisco Fed, titled ""Loose Monetary Policy and Financial Instability.""

The authors find that ""...when the stance of monetary policy is accommodative over an extended period, the likelihood of financial turmoil down the road increases considerably."" No shit, right? Surprisingly, there is ""no empirical study that analyzes the link between the stance of monetary policy and macro-level financial stability.""

There have been many micro-level empirical studies showing the relationship between loose monetary policy and increased risk-taking by households and institutions. What was missing was how this percolates up to the global economy. ""This study fills this gap in the literature using macro-financial data for advanced economies over the last 150 years.""

It has long been understood that institutions need to take additional risk to reach for yield during low interest rate environments. A great example is insurance companies. They have fixed long-term commitments and must take on greater risk to meet required distributions. 

A piece that I found relatable to current events was that ""there exist yield-oriented investors who not only care about the discounted return of their portfolio but place particular emphasis on current returns. Such investors increase their portfolio’s maturity risk when short-term rates fall and vice versa. The authors find empirical support for their hypothesis: after expansionary monetary policy shocks, the maturity of banks’ security holdings rises."" If I understand correctly, this was exactly the problem with SVB. Decisions at the bank regarding the duration of their securities portfolio was set in motion by the loose monetary policy stance. And was probably compounded by the fact that they were without a Chief Risk Officer for 15 months through January 2023. 

Not all periods of accommodative monetary policy and their subsequent crises are identical. In the 70's for example, both the US and UK crises were preceded by accommodative policies that were accompanied by high inflation. The GFC, however, "" was also preceded by accommodative monetary policy, but not by excessive inflation rates. One explanation put forward for the loose stance of monetary policy during the 2000s is asymmetric behavior of central banks that react more strongly to financial busts than to booms.""

There exists some natural rate of interest where the demand for credit exactly equals it's supply. Hold rates above that natural rate, and you have contractionary policy. Loans aren't made, consumption dwindles, and economies falter. Hold rates below that rate, and you have accommodative policy. Accommodative policy is necessary at times, but hold them there for too long, and bizarre things start to happen. Credit overly expands, households and institutions take on more risk, and valuations become distorted. Our central authority is supposed to act independently. In matters of money, decisions are supposed to account for multi-generational effects. It seems as though they've become more beholden to political pressure and base their decisions on short-term changes. 

""The Austrian School of Economics proposed that the seeds of every downturn are sown in the preceding upturn. We may all agree that people miscalculate. A vital Austrian observation was that investors err together. In the Austrian judgement, there is one principal source of collective error: interest rates. Set them too low and people will overreach. They will borrow too much and will always build that redundant, marginal capital project. Set them too high, and they will under do it. They will be fearful of the return on their projects to pay back the rate of interest. At what interest rate would people be led to do just enough and not one thing more? The Austrians had an answer: the rate at which the demand for loans exactly equals their supply. That is, a rate of interest so well founded that, if set by the Federal Reserve, it would cause no disturbance in the general price level, either to the upside or the downside. That is the ""natural rate"".""--(James Grant; The Trouble with Prosperity)",5,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/11r8y2f/loose_monetary_policy_and_financial/,"Loose Monetary Policy and Financial Instability--San Francisco Fed [https://www.frbsf.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/wp2023-06.pdf](https://www.frbsf.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/wp2023-06.pdf)

In a harsh blow to an already-reeling sector, Moody’s Investors Service cut its view on the entire banking system to negative from stable. The firm, part of the big three rating services, said Monday it was making the move in light of key bank failures that prompted regulators to step in Sunday with a dramatic rescue plan for depositors and other institutions impacted by the crisis. “We have changed to negative from stable our outlook on the US banking system to reflect the rapid deterioration in the operating environment following deposit runs at Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Silvergate Bank, and Signature Bank (SNY) and the failures of SVB and SNY,” Moody’s said in a report. The move followed action late Monday, when Moody’s warned it either was downgrading or placing on review for downgrade seven individual institutions.

The moves are important because they could impact credit ratings and thus borrowing costs for the sector. In its downgrade of the entire sector, the rating agency noted the extraordinary actions taken to shore up impacted banks. But it said other institutions with unrealized losses or uninsured depositors still could be at risk. The Federal Reserve established a facility to ensure that institutions hit with liquidity problems would have access to cash. The Treasury Department backstopped the program with $25 billion in funds and vowed that depositors with more than $250,000 at SVB and Signature would have full access to their funds.

But Moody’s said that concerns remain. “Banks with substantial unrealized securities losses and with non-retail and uninsured US depositors may still be more sensitive to depositor competition or ultimate flight, with adverse effects on funding, liquidity, earnings and capital,” the report said. Moody’s on Monday downgraded Signature Bank and said it would remove all ratings.

When the word decentralized currency was popping up in 2020 nft craze they where listening, they worried. 

They now have launch a similar type of payment system relying on crypto type transfers. 
Also, the fed is working on a new digital payment system. 

Also, a few months ago the BIS pushed a big scary warning about the debt that’s not “seen” and that it has increase a lot by financial systems that are not in the Feds/govt eyes/sphere of influence. From random debt offerings to complex web of financial services not easily seen or accounted for. 

Cue the silicone valley bank crash. In which includes the silver gate and signature banks. 
Both that are crypto friendly banks that along Silicon valley had some obscure but extremely highly valuable rich folks and money transfers related to crytpo and VC. 

Maybe others can see where I’m going w this?

Some sort of control. Or more control. 

In a way more stability. In another way a small group of people are putting certain chess pieces together to maybe have more money and influence. 

Not totally sure the end game here or how. 
But it seems all to conveniently related. 
Not that anyone caused the SVB crash but more like BIS knew this might happen and started pushing for their “alternative” plan once it happened. They knew a crytpo fuled venture capital risky behavior would make SVB happen. 
And now BIS has tested their new crytpo transfer system. 

Anyways… how’s my tin hat theory? :)",0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11ress1/the_bis_central_bank_of_central_banks_crypto/,"The BIS (central bank of central banks), crypto control and the prophecy of SVB downfall. My Tin foil hat conspiracy theory The Bank of International settlements has quite the big influence in world affairs. 

When the word decentralized currency was popping up in 2020 nft craze they where listening, they worried. 

They now have launch a similar type of payment system relying on crypto type transfers. 
Also, the fed is working on a new digital payment system. 

Also, a few months ago the BIS pushed a big scary warning about the debt that’s not “seen” and that it has increase a lot by financial systems that are not in the Feds/govt eyes/sphere of influence. From random debt offerings to complex web of financial services not easily seen or accounted for. 

Cue the silicone valley bank crash. In which includes the silver gate and signature banks. 
Both that are crypto friendly banks that along Silicon valley had some obscure but extremely highly valuable rich folks and money transfers related to crytpo and VC. 

Maybe others can see where I’m going w this?

Some sort of control. Or more control. 

In a way more stability. In another way a small group of people are putting certain chess pieces together to maybe have more money and influence. 

Not totally sure the end game here or how.

Hope this helps some of you to take it more seriously this time. 


*""Depositors will have access to their money""*

*""Investors will lose their money ... that's how capitalism works.""*


In the last week, this struck me more than anything. Banks have had insurance to a reasonable amount and now we're promising people and businesses that they'll get their money (even over the insured limit) as long as they are just deposits and not on some risky investment. That's the message I get from Washington's wording. That should have cooled the markets down. Instead some people created the opposite narrative and it's getting dangerous for investors prone to FOMO. 


On top of that, Federal Reserve is taking responsibility for the damage it's inflicted on banks by increasing rates too high too quickly. Despite the new bond buyback facility, if you fail, you're on your. That's what I get from the actions taken and words spoken in the last few days. Therefore I don't expect a dovish fed next week. Federal Reserve will increase their rates once again. IMO it will be another 25 bps. The rate of which it will increase in the next few meeting *""will depend on the data""* as Jerome Powell says at almost every meeting since last year Q3. 


There is no reason higher interest rates should cause any more problems, because the fed will provide cash for MBSs and government bonds. So when they say it's not a bailout it's really not if they don't keep doing this forever. The only thing that favours banks at this point is the lack of consequences for over-extending right before interest rate hikes. Let's say they borrow for their MBS and bonds? What are they supposed to do with it now while FDIC watching them like a hawk? 


I'm pleasantly surprised that FDIC is on top of things that they intervened the way they did when they had to. So this brings me to my next point, consequences. With no bailout for investors during this administration, investors in stocks should be extra careful where they put their money. The drop in banking stocks is fully justified. IMO they will decline further. If a bank fails, you will have your securities as long their books aren't baked and you will have your cash... eventually. But the bank will be no more. I suggest everyone takes a deep look at where their securities are, where their cash is. If you have gold or crypto, do you really want to keep it in a bank or exchange that you cannot trust. The next 6 moths is all about risk management... because some banks didn't do theirs right. And now we have real-life examples at nearly hundreds of billions of dollars of assets being risked because they overextended. It's not a conspiracy theory. This all happened. 


We may see panic and even stock market closure for a day ~~if~~ when one of the larger banks go under. At a time of depleting savings and working class slowly running out of cash, this would create total chaos. I can even see Washington increasing the debt ceiling quickly when they need to supply cash to people and not banks this time. I see that as a more likely and a better fix than bailing out a bank. 
Thanks for reading. 


TL:DR The scenario I see has the fed increasing rates at 25bps until they can't and more banks going under in the next 6 months. You as investors may lose money on bank stocks and it may take time having access to your other investments and cash. What's guaranteed is only what's on your contract. No bailouts. Do yourself a favour and asses your risks and manage carefully. 


P.S. This doesn't mean you can't or won't make money by being long. You can for a while until you can't.

Charles Schwab CEO Walt Bettinger said Tuesday that his firm is still experiencing sizable inflows, contrary to fears that the banking crisis brought on by the Silicon Valley Bank collapse is spreading in the sector.

“What we’re seeing is asset inflows to the firm in significant numbers,” Bettinger told CNBC’s Sara Eisen on “The Exchange.”

He said Schwab clients moved almost $42 billion in net new assets to the firm in February. Month to date, they’ve averaged about $2 billion a day, the CEO said.

Meanwhile, Bettinger revealed he bought 50,000 shares Tuesday morning for his personal account. “That much confidence I certainly have in this company,” he said. Those shares are worth nearly $3 million at Schwab’s open price Tuesday.

The Westlake, Texas-based financial company saw its stock fall nearly 12% on Monday, and it rebounded 9.2% on Tuesday. Schwab took hits along with other financial firms with massive bond holdings.

The fear is that these firms, like Silicon Valley Bank, would need to sell their bond holdings early at large losses in order to cover deposit withdrawals. But Bettinger stressed his firm doesn’t buy long-duration assets and has a low loan-to-deposit ratio.

“What I’ve heard from the advisors that I spoke with yesterday is great confidence in our firm. ... They know how conservative we are. They know we don’t take risks,” Bettinger said. “That’s why we don’t go out a long way in terms of duration, and that’s why we maintain access to liquidity in the way that we do.”

“Our bank is very conservatively managed. If you look into the holdings of the bank, we have about 10% of client deposits outstanding in loans,” Bettinger said.

The demise of Silicon Valley Bank, as well as crypto-focused Signature Bank, prompted extraordinary rescue action from regulators and caused a financial shock that rocked markets, especially shares of regional banks. In addition to backstopping the deposits at SVB and Signature Bank, federal regulators also announced an additional funding facility for troubled banks.",569,94,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11rhc1f/schwab_ceo_says_firm_is_seeing_significant/,"Schwab CEO says firm is seeing significant inflows even as stock gets hit https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/14/charles-schwab-ceo-says-firm-is-seeing-significant-inflows-even-as-stock-gets-hit-during-banking-selloff.html

# [Dow futures fall 500 points as Credit Suisse slide adds to financial sector woes: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/14/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures fell on Wednesday as pressure on the financial sector increased with shares of Credit Suisse, a Swiss Bank that has large U.S. and global operations, tumbling more than 20%.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 567 points, or 1.8%, while Nasdaq-100 futures lost 1.6%. The 1.7% slide in S&amp;P 500 futures put the broad index’s 2.1% year-to-date gain at risk.
*****
&gt; In recent days, a crisis in the financial sector has centered around regional banks as Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed, both casualties of poor management in the face of eight interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve in the last 12 months. Wednesday morning attention turned to the big banks with shares of Credit Suisse hitting an all-time low.
*****
&gt; Saudi National Bank, Credit Suisse’s largest investor, said Wednesday it could not provide any more funding, according to a Reuters report. This comes after the Swiss lender said earlier this week it had found “certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting” for the years 2021 and 2022.
*****
&gt; U.S.-traded shares of Credit Suisse dropped more than 25% in the premarket.
*****
&gt; As Credit Suisse dragged down the European Bank sector, U.S. big bank shares declined in sympathy. Citigroup and Wells Fargo shed 4% each, while Goldman Sachs and Bank of America fell around 3% apiece. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) lost 2.3% in premarket trading, giving up its 2% pop on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Regional banks, which rebounded Tuesday to lift sentiment for the broader market, fell back into the red again. The SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) was down 3% in the premarket, led by losses in Old National Bancorp, Zions Bancorp and Fifth Third Bancorp. To be sure, shares of First Republic Bank were clinging to gains.
*****
&gt; Peter Boockvar of Bleakley Financial Group said pressure on the financial sector was growing broadly because the bank failures have changed the mindset of the industry.
*****
&gt; “What this is telling us is there’s the potential for just a large credit extension contraction that banks are going to embark on [to] focus more on firming up balance sheets and rather than focus on lending,” said Boockvar to CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”
*****
&gt; “It’s a balance sheet rethink that the market’s have” Boockvar added, citing that many banks may have bought longer maturity bonds that have reduced in value since the Fed started raising rates. “Also you have to wonder with a lot of these banks if they’re going to have to start going out and raising equity.”
*****
&gt; Elsewhere on Wednesday, investors will gain more insight into the state of the economy through retail sales and producer price index data due out before the bell.

The impact has been felt across the leading stock markets globally with banking institutions facing the threat of a cascading effect.

Reportedly, analyst and author Robert Kiyosaki, known for his bestseller “Rich Dad, Poor Dad"", has now predicted that Credit Suisse, one of Europe’s largest investment banks, is the next institution at the risk of collapse.

Robert Kiyosaki believes the US dollar will weaken, putting the country in “serious trouble.""

Kiyosaki, who had correctly predicted the 2008 Lehman Brothers’ collapse, cites the bond market as the root of the problem and warns of a weakened US dollar.

In a recent appearance on Fox News show, ‘Cavuto: Coast to Coast’, Kiyosaki warned that the bond market is much larger than the stock market.

He added that “the Fed is up, and they’re the firemen and the arson."" He said that the US dollar is losing its hegemony in the world, and that the Fed is “going to print more and more and more of it,"" to keep it from sinking.

The Rich Dad Company founder also expressed his concerns about the “perfect storm"" brewing due to the bond market crash and the upcoming retirement of his generation.

He expressed concern about the current market environment and the impact it may have on pension plans and individual retirement accounts (IRAs).

Kiyosaki warned that the American taxpayers will bear the brunt of bank bailouts in the event of a financial crisis.

11s0b6u,2023-03-15 15:49:12,wallstreetbets,GreatTraderOnizuka,"FEDs are not bailing out banks, they are bailing out the bond market."," 

I want all of you to succeed in whatever investing you do. So take 5 minutes to digest this.

Recently, banks like Signature and SVB were forced to liquidate their losing bond positions to pay back cash deposits. Even after liquidation, the banks did not have enough cash to pay out the deposits. FDIC insurance kicked in and the Feds responded because 90% of cash deposits were not insured (over 250k deposit.)

Before the bank failures. Short term treasuries were being offered at 5% and the markets were not interested. Now the bond market essentially received a bond buy back. The HTM securities are now all priced at 5% rates. Essentially the Fed just bailed out the bond market with a reset to par value. With so many bonds priced at 5%, it is hard for the Feds to continue to hike and 5% yields are very attractive. Essentially all grade A bonds held by banks (basically all bonds) are guaranteed by the Fed at par until the purchasing program ends. Are they going to continue to hike until more things break? Who knows?! But immunity is power.

~~Power Overwhelming; Cheat Enabled: Immunity Granted~~

&gt;!I think it could be said to be hike proof and inflation proof since the yields don’t matter.!&lt;


When these banks failed, the Feds also looked into paper losses at banks such as JPMorgan, etc. See below. 10-K that reflect December 31, 2022

Citigroup (C) loss per share ($16.02) 33% of stock price

AFS $256,608 million cost - $249,679 million fair value = $5,929 million loss

HTM $268,863 million cost - $243,648 million fair value = $25,215 million loss

\*Total loss $31,144 million

JPMorgan Chase (JPM) loss per share ($16.00) 12% of stock price

AFS $216,217 million cost - $205,857 million fair value = $10,360 million loss

HTM $425,372 million cost - $388,648 million fair value = $36,724 million loss

\*Total loss $47,084 million

Signature Bank (SBNY) loss per share $51.44 73% of stock price

AFS $21,071 million cost - $18,594 million fair value = $2,477 million loss

HTM $7,780 million cost - $7,018 million fair value = $762 million loss

\*Total loss $3,239 million

U.S. Bancorp (USB) loss per share $12.68 31% of stock price

AFS $81,450 million cost - $72,910 million fair value = $8,540 million loss

HTM $88,740 million cost - $77,874 million fair value = $10,866 million loss

\*Total loss $19,406 million

First Republic Bank (FRC) loss per share $28.15 34% of stock price

AFS $3,817 million cost - $3,347 million fair value = $470 million loss

HTM $28,359 million cost - $23,587 million fair value = $4,772 million loss

\*Total loss $5,242 million

A majority of these securities are long term treasuries, and mortgage backed securities. (Remember when money was lent out cheaply in 2015, 2016, 2019, 2020, 2021?)

The 60/40 bond portfolio has failed. The stock market dropped 25% from it's high to recent lows. The bond market on the other hand is down 10-15% average on low risk A grade bonds.

**Bond Bailout:**

[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/monetary20230312a1.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/monetary20230312a1.pdf)'

Bonds were impacted a lot due to inflation and interest rate hikes. Every-time inflation went up, bonds were worth less because the dollar strength deteriorated. Money borrowed is returned with money that is worth less. Every time the interest rates were hiked, old bonds become worth less as new bonds have higher yields. The bond market moves in tandem and pricing is all connected. New bonds issued, the old bonds are adjusted to worth less.

With the new bank term funding program. The Feds have created the great reset for the bond market. All old bonds held by banking institutions are valued by the Fed at par value. If the retail price was $1000, it is now worth $1000 provided it was used as collateral to borrow money from the Fed at 5% interest rate.

Why must banks collateralize the paper loss securities? Because it's free money in the short term and saves their paper losses provided they borrow at current rates.

The math is simple to prove that this is beneficial.

Conditions:

$1000 paper loss on $10000.

Loan at 5% at par value.

The HTM security is worth $9000 present value. If you take a loan it is valued at $10000. Essentially a stop loss/hedge on the position and you net $1000 in profit. If the loan is held for 1 year. 5% interest on loan would be a $500. There is $10000 in cash flow for investments, loans, operating. If the loan is not taken, it's a $1000 paper loss and $9000 that is illiquid until maturity unless sold at a loss.

What this means is that all paper losses have been wiped out by the Fed and the bond market is now priced as if there was no interest hikes and 2% inflation. When there is no interest hike and 2% inflation, it was very difficult to get 2% interest payments.

Again: Before the bank failures. Short term treasuries were being offered at 5% and the markets were not interested. Now the bond market essentially received a bond buy back. The HTM securities are now all priced at 5% rates. Essentially the Fed just bailed out the bond market with a reset in interest rates. With so many bonds priced at 5%, it is hard for the Feds to continue to hike and even if they do hike, bonds are granted immunity* 

**Notes from me:**

I can imagine the 60/40 portfolio becoming very popular again or even 50/50 as investors and fund managers adjust the portfolios. I think a majority of portfolios are hedged but not at the current 60/40 ratio. I also think the stock market will crash when the fed fund rate comes to a halt in increases.

See figure below when the Fed funds rate halted and plateued, the stock market crashed some time after. I think profit taking is always a smart choice in conditions like this. I would add to winners when all conditions are favorable, booming times. I think it is smart to start hedging into bonds, potentially SPTS and brace for when markets go into turmoil. Remember, *don't buy the dip, buy from dips.*

I want all of you to succeed in whatever investing you do. So take 5 minutes to digest this.

Recently, banks like Signature and SVB were forced to liquidate their losing bond positions to pay back cash deposits. Even after liquidation, the banks did not have enough cash to pay out the deposits. FDIC insurance kicked in and the Feds responded because 90% of cash deposits were not insured (over 250k deposit.)

Before the bank failures. Short term treasuries were being offered at 5% and the markets were not interested. Now the bond market essentially received a bond buy back. The HTM securities are now all priced at 5% rates. Essentially the Fed just bailed out the bond market with a reset to par value. With so many bonds priced at 5%, it is hard for the Feds to continue to hike and 5% yields are very attractive. Essentially all grade A bonds held by banks (basically all bonds) are guaranteed by the Fed at par until the purchasing program ends. Are they going to continue to hike until more things break? Who knows?! But immunity is power.

~~Power Overwhelming; Cheat Enabled: Immunity Granted~~

&gt;!I think it could be said to be hike proof and inflation proof since the yields don’t matter.!&lt;


When these banks failed, the Feds also looked into paper losses at banks such as JPMorgan, etc. See below. 10-K that reflect December 31, 2022

Citigroup (C) loss per share ($16.02) 33% of stock price

AFS $256,608 million cost - $249,679 million fair value = $5,929 million loss

HTM $268,863 million cost - $243,648 million fair value = $25,215 million loss

\*Total loss $31,144 million

JPMorgan Chase (JPM) loss per share ($16.00) 12% of stock price

AFS $216,217 million cost - $205,857 million fair value = $10,360 million loss

HTM $425,372 million cost - $388,648 million fair value = $36,724 million loss

\*Total loss $47,084 million

Signature Bank (SBNY) loss per share $51.44 73% of stock price

\*Total loss $3,239 million

U.S. Bancorp (USB) loss per share $12.68 31% of stock price

AFS $81,450 million cost - $72,910 million fair value = $8,540 million loss

HTM $88,740 million cost - $77,874 million fair value = $10,866 million loss

\*Total loss $19,406 million

First Republic Bank (FRC) loss per share $28.15 34% of stock price

A majority of these securities are long term treasuries, and mortgage backed securities. (Remember when money was lent out cheaply in 2015, 2016, 2019, 2020, 2021?)

The 60/40 bond portfolio has failed. The stock market dropped 25% from it's high to recent lows. The bond market on the other hand is down 10-15% average on low risk A grade bonds.

**Bond Bailout:**

[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/monetary20230312a1.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/monetary20230312a1.pdf)'

Bonds were impacted a lot due to inflation and interest rate hikes. Every-time inflation went up, bonds were worth less because the dollar strength deteriorated. Money borrowed is returned with money that is worth less. Every time the interest rates were hiked, old bonds become worth less as new bonds have higher yields. The bond market moves in tandem and pricing is all connected. New bonds issued, the old bonds are adjusted to worth less.

With the new bank term funding program. The Feds have created the great reset for the bond market. All old bonds held by banking institutions are valued by the Fed at par value. If the retail price was $1000, it is now worth $1000 provided it was used as collateral to borrow money from the Fed at 5% interest rate.

Why must banks collateralize the paper loss securities? Because it's free money in the short term and saves their paper losses provided they borrow at current rates.

The math is simple to prove that this is beneficial.

Conditions:

$1000 paper loss on $10000.

Loan at 5% at par value.

The HTM security is worth $9000 present value. If you take a loan it is valued at $10000. Essentially a stop loss/hedge on the position and you net $1000 in profit. If the loan is held for 1 year. 5% interest on loan would be a $500. There is $10000 in cash flow for investments, loans, operating. If the loan is not taken, it's a $1000 paper loss and $9000 that is illiquid until maturity unless sold at a loss.

What this means is that all paper losses have been wiped out by the Fed and the bond market is now priced as if there was no interest hikes and 2% inflation. When there is no interest hike and 2% inflation, it was very difficult to get 2% interest payments.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Charles Schwab has ample liquidity, the chief executive of the bank and brokerage said on Tuesday, moving to allay concerns about a ""doomsday scenario"" that has weighed broadly on bank stocks after the failure of two U.S. lenders since Friday.

""We have not raised capital and we are not in the market at this point for M&amp;A transactions,"" Walt Bettinger, CEO of Charles Schwab, told Reuters in an interview.

The firm saw an influx of $4 billion in assets to the parent company on Friday as clients moved assets to Schwab from other firms, Bettinger said.

Schwab on Monday reported that total client assets slid to $7.38 trillion in February, down 4% compared with a year ago.

Bettinger said Schwab was comfortable with the assets on its bank portfolio -- which is separate from its brokerage business -- contrasting it with other companies that had run into trouble.

""Our available for-sale portfolio is short in duration and high in quality, and our held-to-maturity is slightly longer in duration but still short compared to many people, and very high-quality,"" said Bettinger, who has led Schwab since the 2008 financial crisis.

Banks can classify bonds as “held-to-maturity” (HTM) and are not required to count changes in value if the securities are kept until they are repaid, or they can keep the bonds as “available-for-sale” (AFS), which means they must count unrealized losses against capital, but are free to sell the securities at any time.

Compared to many regional banks that have come under pressure in the last week, Schwab has higher unrealized securities portfolio losses in comparison to its capital levels, said Richard Repetto, a managing director at Piper Sandler.

“That said, due to robust supplemental liquidity sources, we think it is very unlikely that SCHW will ever need to sell HTM securities to meet deposit withdrawal requests,” with $150 billion to $200 billion of available liquidity, he said in a note to clients on Monday.

The pressure on Schwab's stock eased after Bettinger told CNBC earlier on Tuesday that he had bought 50,000 Schwab shares while billionaire investor Ron Baron said he ""modestly increased"" his position in Schwab.

Schwab's shares closed up 9.2% at $56.68 on Tuesday, along with a broad rise in bank shares. Schwab shares, however, are down 25.6% from their close last Wednesday, the day before many bank shares began a downward spiral in reaction to problems at Silicon Valley Bank. SVB was shut down by regulators on Friday.

About 82% of deposits held by Schwab were insured, falling under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's limit of $250,000.

The bank has ""access to significant liquidity"" including an estimated $100 billion of cash flow from cash on hand, portfolio-related cash flows, plus new assets.

Now mid day we had the Swiss say basically that CS was “too big to fail.” We then had a $4 pump on one candle. I do not think I have ever seen a $4 15minute candle outside of FOMC or other market breaking news. That was one impressive recovery…

Something that was very interestingly noted this morning was that the 2y/3m yields inverted for the first time since January 2001.. as you can see that led to a surprise 50bps CUT by the fed and also a massive 4.8% green day when they did that… IF we get a cut tomorrow I would 100% ride a 0dte call to glory…   
 

Now do I think we get a surprise cut? No not really… especially with data tomorrow and Friday to come still and FOMC being next week already… I am still not convinced we get a fed pause at FOMC Wednesday still…

Honestly something that is pretty interesting today is how strong some of TECH was… the top dogs all finished green outside of Tesla today… Incredibly the Nasdaq still closed a red day though… Looking at the sell pressure/ breath of SPY, NASD and NYSE it is very clear that there was a heavy rotation out of NYSE into SPY/ NASD today. 

I understand a rotation out of the banking sector right now and I suppose that money has to flow somewhere… however, I find it a little bit odd to pile into TECH in a situation like this. To me big tech is not “safe” money nor is it somewhere you should be looking to put your money IF there truly is a bank run/ financial crisis happening before our eyes… Very interesting to watch today and watching VOLD. 

The fact that SPY was able to close over its opening price today with the constant sell pressure that VOLD (NYSE) had all day is incredibly impressive. Even VOLSPD (S&amp;P500) had constant sell pressure most of the day… There was so many rogue bounces and rogue candles today that were hard to explain. Today of the last 5 tradings days (since the bank run issues) was definitely the hardest to trade. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

There is really not much of a supply and demand update today. The biggest thing to note is that we did bounce direction off 385.87 demand once again today. That would re-confirm 385.87 as a strong support and would once again make our upside target 394.68 demand (now resistance). 

The only reason to suspect downside is if we were to establish a new supply (resistance) short of 405.17. According to the technical we are in the process of doing just that within the next few trading days. IF tomorrow closes under 385 we realistically will most likely establish a new supply (resistance) at 389.42. 

We are in a holding pattern from a S/D stand point. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

We once again find ourselves in a blue falling wedge on the SPY daily. This falling wedge seems to get re-written every day for the last few days. This tells me that price action really is undecisive here. Actually if you look at the last 4 days of trading candle wise this reminds me a lot of February 22nd to February 27th. 

There realistically is not enough data to know where we are headed next… And honestly anyone who claims “I KNEW we were going to retest 383-385 today…” “Or I knew we wouldn’t hold over 390 after yesterday.” Is a big fat liar. Yes from a technical stand point we can 100% call out levels and regardless of technical or news driven we will eventually hit a level… however, we are 100% in a news driven market with the banking issues and fed funds rates right now. None of today was predictable unless you some how had insider news on CS. Just like no one could have predicted SPY would put in a $4 green candle at 215pm today… 

Anyone swinging options in this market is crazy if you ask me. One tweet is all it takes to send this market tumbling or rumbling. IT 100% is best to sit cash and play whats in front of us… 

The biggest things to watch for tomorrow is this falling wedge. Resistance will be at 387.9 tomorrow. Which means unless we open red and hold red all day we will break that resistance for the falling wedge which should open the upside. With that falling wedge being broken bulls will once again attempt to take back 390.1 pivot point. However, if the bulls either reject the falling wedge or reject 390.1 pivot point tomorrow then we are very likely going to see a sell off back into the low 380s if not 370s. 

This market is what I would call extremely fragile right now. Everyone is 100% on edge right now and no one knows whats going to happen in the next week, month or year… and there is a lot of big money that is getting nervous. With the fact that we had our 4th 150mil+ volume day in a row for the first time since may 2022 there is A LOT of trading happening behind the scenes. Tread lightly.

Much like SPY there just isn’t much going on yet. However, technical fully support that we are about to see a new supply (resistance) put in. IF we were to close red tomorrow and especially close under 3895 we most likely will establish 3955 as supply (resistance). IF you look at the last 3 trading days they all hard rejected attempts to breakout and close over that level. 

IF we see 3955 established as a new supply (resistance) that would be an incredibly strong resistance that is going to take a lot of effort to break through. That would open up the potential for downside to 3833.

Here on futures I have highlighted this black range from 3888 to 3955 which 5 of the last 5 tradings days has closed within. This is a major level that we have currently established as consolidation. 

The markets here are consolidating waiting for the next move. Futures also has a red falling wedge formed that too keeps getting the goal post moved almost every day it seems. That resistance lies at 3948. 

Currently futures is attempting to close over key 3920 pivot point. After this double top off 3955 we should have and did get downside. The question now is will this double top turn around and immediately form a double bottom? 

If bulls can retake the day tomorrow we will need to take out and most importantly close over 3955 in order to see continuation. If there is a rejection and closure under 3955 again tomorrow I would 100% expect a retrace back to 3888 area. 

Futures levels:  
 Supply- 4055

The VIX has been absolutely on the move the last 5 trading days. Seems to be that anytime the VIX crosses that 26.9 area we get a huge retracement. The VIX is clearly remaining elevated here as people are piling into those longer term protections.

The Dollar actually got a really big bounce today closing back in that 104.7 area. With this big bounce off that 103.6 area we are now trading back in the 104.6 to 105.1 consolidation range we spent most of march trading within.

Realistically not too surprising with the CS news this morning we had a massive rate drop on the 10yr today. There was a ton of money that piled into the safety of bonds/ yields today. 

The question remains what happens next? We saw a similar situation on Monday and the next day the 10yr shot right back up as people piled back into the market on Tuesday with the good CPI read. If there is no new “good” data like CPI (though I will say the PPI reading was REALLY good this morning) is there enough reason to get people out of the 10yr and back into the market?

Today ended up being a green day but honestly today was a pretty frustrating trading day. There was many times where we would have everything lined up for the perfect put opportunity and we would even have price action breaking through key levels that generally signal a good put opportunity only for price action to take a hard $2 reversal. 

I don’t know if I have ever seen so many $1 one minute candle reversals. Today was very difficult to trade as I felt like price action was moving so aggressively for one and so erratically for two that it was very difficult to “stay ahead.” This week and some of last I started using breakeven stops and setting profitable stop losses (generally 5%) which saved me numerous times from some of these incredible reversals we had. 

Todays price action compared to the last 5 days felt very artificial and unpredictable. Today despite similar high volume and trends on VOLD did not trade anywhere remotely close to the other 4 trading days that were similar.",47,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11s907y/the_volatility_continues_31523_spy_es_futures_dxy/,"The volatility continues… 3-15-23 SPY/ ES Futures, DXY, 10YR and VIX Daily Market Analysis Well I went to bed last night thinking a double top off 3955 was possible but after writing my daily TA last night thinking this was setup for a bullish push into FOMC next week.

Today ended up being a green day but honestly today was a pretty frustrating trading day. There was many times where we would have everything lined up for the perfect put opportunity and we would even have price action breaking through key levels that generally signal a good put opportunity only for price action to take a hard $2 reversal. 

I don’t know if I have ever seen so many $1 one minute candle reversals. Today was very difficult to trade as I felt like price action was moving so aggressively for one and so erratically for two that it was very difficult to “stay ahead.” This week and some of last I started using breakeven stops and setting profitable stop losses (generally 5%) which saved me numerous times from some of these incredible reversals we had. 

Todays price action compared to the last 5 days felt very artificial and unpredictable. Today despite similar high volume and trends on VOLD did not trade anywhere remotely close to the other 4 trading days that were similar."

Today, I will be talking about why bank failures are on the way, and it will cause a global deflationary malaise in which central banks cannot quickly respond to.

First things first, the big four US major banks are not going to fail, they are effective government-run utilities at this point. The size of the total Banking sector in the US is close to USD23 trillion. This is relatively safe, it is heavily regulated, most of which is FDIC insured. There may be some runs on the smaller banks, but I don't expect the second stage of the crisis to come from here.

But there is a large banking system outside of the united states, and almost all of it is dealing in dollars.  This is the Eurodollar market. 95+% of global trade is done using USD, and so if I am a Korean car manufacturer that needs to borrow dollars to finance the purchase of steel from China, I borrow in dollars from Korean bank, which mayble has a swap agreement with HSBC or a Panamanian bank from my local operating currrency into dollars. The entire system is hidden from view is the size of it is estimated to be anywhere from USD30 to 50 trillion and it finances almost the entire global supply chain.

And the stresses on this system is extreme and is happening on two levels.

First on the domestic US level, The FRA-OSIS spread is at a higher level today than doing the depth of the covid crash in 2020. It is at 70 today. This measures the spread between the U.S. three-month forward rate agreement and the overnight index swap rate. the FRA represents market expectation of future borrowing costs for banks versus the OIS which is the current borrowing cost for banks. And it blowing out to the highest level since Lehman is that market participants anticipate large credit risks coming out of the banking system. When the Fed came out with the backstop of deposit, what is very surprising is that the FRA-OIS spread continued to open up, instead of going back down. It is a sign that banks are starting to be wery of lending to each other.

At the same time, Eurodollar futures spiked at a larger than that after when Lehamn brothers failed. Remember, eurodollar futures are demand for dollars stored ""OUTSIDE"" of the united states. This shows massive bid for dollar deposits outside of the United States.

So what does this mean? See, the fed could bail out the US banking system, so any further deterioration of the US banking system I think will be limited, although you could still have some regional banks fail and be managed by the FDIC. But the big US banks are getting very very nervous and percieving credit risks and not lending. This will led to high costs for interbank lending. But where the riskiest part of this chain is where it then links up to the Eurodollar market. What happens if overseas bank start defaulting on dollar loans that they have on their balance sheet? Who will come to their rescure?

What happens if those offshore money center banks start facing deposit runs because the loans they gave out in dollars are probably going to see defaults? Afterall, if you do have dollars, why would you put them into a 0% deposit no insurance panamanian bank, especially if there is no FDIC covering those deposits. No, you would want to get it into the US to earn 4-5% in treasuries and money market. So dollars deposited in these offshore banks have been decreasing all year.

This is why you are seeing pressure on Credit Suisse and DB and HSBC, because they are large global money center banks. What happens if these global banks collapse because they cannot attract enough dollar funding? Well, they would bid the hell out of dollar deposits, which is what we are seeing through the eurodollar futures, and once the collapse happens, it would look like the great depression 2.0 as 20-40 trillion of lent-out ""Dollars"" simply vanish in the blink of an eye.

So the threat of a global deflationary collapse is very much real, and we are staring at its mutation from the US to the Eurodollar market.",260,139,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11s96uk/why_svb_is_just_the_beginning_part_ii_eurodollar/,"Why SVB is just the beginning: Part II Eurodollar edition, from a investment analyst last week I wrote about why the SVB failure is tied to the fall in bond prices caused by the fed rate hikes, imbuing 4-6 trillion in bond losses globally, around 1 trillion of which fell on the banking sector.

And now everyone is moaning about Credit Suisse, ignoring that Saudi Arabia *can't* increase their stake above 10% due to regulations.

In SVB's case they bought a lot of bonds (treasuries) when rates were much lower with customer deposits. When rates were low, this was a win-win situation,; They paid little to nothing to customer on deposits and earned interest on the bonds bought. (Free money for nothing!)

When rates started rising, they had unrealize losses on the bonds but didn't have to recognize the losses because of current accounting rules. As such, under current bank stress test, unrealized losses were never reflected in the stress tests for sufficient capital requirements. However, if the accounting rules were different and required mark-to market, those losses would have been recognized  much earlier flagging the bank as failing the stress tests before the bank kept accumulating additional deposits. This may have prevented a high growth bank like SVM from a total collapse that happened today.

You want to prevent a similar scenario in the future? Change the damn accounting rules!
