By selling at a loss, they drove up losses, making their results look worse and caused perceived risk to rise. Depositors then fleed as a mob, exacerbating SVB's capital inflow needs.  Perhaps there was an oversight rule that drove them to sell, but I'm not sure.

The bank did a very normal thing of selling some of their backing securities due to more tech companies using their cash reserves with funding slowing down over the last year. 

With interest rates higher though those bonds they were using to back deposits were at a couple percent loss. Not a huge deal except it moved that loss to the banks books and tanked their stock price. 

Now a banks stock price isn’t really that correlated to their financial solvency, they were backed on deposits at a rate of 50% which is almost twice what you’re supposed to be by law. But yet again VC’s who think they understand everything decided this meant the bank was going under and coordinated the simultaneous withdrawal of billions of dollars in deposits.

Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB) Shares Dropped Over 60% Before Trading was Halted

The Effect was Felt Throughout the Financial Sector
In the Past 5 Days:

	•	PacWest Bancorp is down 51%
	•	Charles Schwab is down 23.75%
	•	Bank of America is down 11.9%
	•	Goldman Sachs is down 8.08%
	•	JPMorgan is down 7.88%

What Happened?

-	Late Wednesday, Silicon Valley Bank surprised the market by announcing it needed to raise $2.5 billion in stock. The bank had been forced to sell all of its available-for-sale bonds at a $1.8 billion loss as its startup clients withdrew deposits, it said.

-	It’s reported Friday morning that the efforts to raise capital had failed and that SVB had pivoted toward a potential sale.

-	SVB failed on Friday after it couldn’t find a buyer, with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. taking over its assets and liabilities

-	SVB was a major bank for venture-backed companies, which were already under pressure due to higher interest rates

-	This marks the largest U.S. bank failure since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago",2,bayarea

The big issues was that 96%+ of their deposits are over the FDIC insurance. Just about all of these big deposits are with Silicon Valley startups. Startups are not doing well. The federal government regulates how banks invest their money and how much can be invested, but not on who you get deposits from (this may need to change). 

Since their deposits were largely in 1 industry and over the FDIC insurance, plus these startups did not spend money on private insurance for their bank deposits(yes you can insurance your bank accounts above FDIC through private insurance), it leaves them susceptible to a run.

There is a youtube channel called Patrick Boyle who is a hedgefund manager. He said they also have a lot of startups from Crypto currency and the crypto crash started the bank run too. 

It was more that they did not have a diversified depositor base and their depositors were too cheap to carry additional bank insurance. 

I think the government needs to look at new regulations

1. diversity of deposits. needs to be in different industries.

2. Requiring businesses to carry separate bank insurance based on a percentage of what they have in the bank. 

3. FDIC should not pay for this. It just raises taxes on the rest of us to cover business risk. No screw them. Carry their own insurance.",2,bayarea

Then he went to both your neighbors and asked for 10$ and told them he could get them 11$ by the following Wednesday. 

Then he went to another four houses and did the same thing with the promise to pay them back 11$ in two weeks.

He used the money from the people who he promised to pay back in two weeks in order to give you and your neighbors $11 each.

Suddenly you, your neighbors, and the people who he hasn't even paid back yet are like ""wow, this guy must be really onto something because he's delivering returns like he promised would happen.""

He tells you he can do it again if you'd like, so this time you and your neighbors give him $100 each.

Also a lot of people who heard about it start to send him money to use his investment strategy on.

He also promises that the longer you leave the money with him, the better your returns will be.

Several people analyze the investment strategy he claims to be using, and say it doesn't add up.

Those people warn the SEC and media that they think something fraudulent is going on, and the SEC and media ignore them for the next 8 years.

Eventually Madoff tells his son's what he's doing because new investments have leveled off, and pretty soon he thinks he won't have enough to cover the fake returns anymore.

His sons, horrified to learn that it was a ponzi scheme this whole time, tell on him, and the scam comes to a very public close.


So the overall difference is like Madoff was selling imaginary gold bars. They never existed in the first place. There was no real strategy. He paid people back with the same money they and others gave him.

SVB it was like they bought a bunch of cars that will *eventually* be considered classics, and therefore more valuable. Right now they're just nice cars that left the lot, so they've lost some short term value. They bought too heavily and didn't leave enough cash in reserve for the people who want their money back now rather than in 10 years when they can sell the cars at a profit.

Most banks actually do what SVB did except for:

1. They have more diversity. Some investments will be worth more within a year, and some will be worth more in 30 years (whereas SVB was all about the 10 year bonds).

2. They keep better cash reserves based on the amount in accounts that are over the insured limit (whereas for SVB almost everything was over the insured limit).


Banks have to use their reserves to invest in *something* because they need to make money. They can't afford branches and staff and online portals for free. At the moment SVB seems like it was a legitimate bank. Although bonds are generally a safe investment their timing was poorly chosen, and because of the nature of who their clients are, they should've kept larger cash reserves. Hindsight is 20/20.",4,bayarea

If there's a buyer, than it's extremely likely *nobody* will lose any money from this -- not uninsured depositors at SVB, not the purchasing bank.

(The important thing to understand here is that SVB isn't a trash asset, it's actually a *very well* capitalized bank that ran into a minor liquidity crisis that turned into a major liquidity crisis because they mismanaged their communication when announcing a fundraising round and people got spooked and started a run on the bank.  They just didn't have liquid cash on hand *right now* to meet their immediate needs.  So this isn't a matter of getting a bank who's willing to buy a plate of poop; this is a matter of finding a bank capable of bearing the load in the short-term who'll profit long-term because they'll have acquired a ton of new accounts at a fire sale price.)

But that deal really needs to be done by start-of-business Monday morning.  If there's a deal announced later today or on Sunday, then Monday morning will come and it'll be like nothing happened.  The hiccups that happened due to the bank not being available Friday afternoon will all be resolved because the money will just all be there on Monday, and so the impact will just be minor annoyances.   (This outcome is extremely likely to the point it's all-but-certain.)

If there's *not* a deal announced by Monday morning or very *very* shortly thereafter, then this very quickly turns into an extinction level event for startups with massive ripple effects on other companies and is the inciting event of the Next Great Recession.",1,technology

If a bank fails simply due to a run, that means they have a valuable business (just a current lack of trust). They will almost certainly get bought by someone (e.g. JPMC, Goldman) and their depositors will get their money back. Won’t be good for people who invested in the bank but that’s not who people typically care about here. Also, the entity buying the bank has a huge incentive to bid with a price that includes making everyone whole, because that calms people down, and will help prevent a run on their own bank.

if no one buys them, unsecured depositors won’t get all their money back, but they’ll still get a decent portion. If they’re in fact solvent but not liquid, then hypothetically you could just wait a long time and everyone gets their money back. The FDIC won’t wait that long, but it will be significantly better than if everyone pulled deposits at once right away. Although I will say, if no one buys you, there’s some doubt as to whether you are actually solvent…

Cash sitting in a vault doesn't do that. Esp. when even risk-free securities can earn something. But investing in capital is risky, so returns required by a bank's shareholders are way higher than risk-free returns. 

Also, banks do buy both goods and services, and quite a lot of them. Even the payroll they pay to their employees is via cash/cash-equivalents payments. And market salaries increase in an inflationary environment, as do all other goods and services. To make things worse, this effect obviously accrues over time, and fast in an inflationary environment. Think about an extreme case, say hyperinflation - if a bank sits on 1,000,000 today, in a few days/weeks (depending on the inflation) with this money, it may not be able to buy a loaf of bread for its canteen. So a similar devaluation is going on, but on a (much) smaller scale at all times.",0,Economics

**How Does A Large Bank Collapse In 48 Hours?**
  
This week, the go-to bank for US tech startups rapidly came unglued, leaving its high-powered customers and investors in limbo. Silicon Valley Bank, facing a sudden bank run and capital crisis, spectacularly collapsed Friday morning and was taken over by federal regulators. It was the largest failure of a US bank since Washington Mutual in 2008.
  
**What is SVB?**
  
Founded in 1983, SVB specialized in banking for tech startups. It provided financing for almost half of US venture-backed technology and health care companies.
  
While relatively unknown outside of Silicon Valley, SVB was among the top 20 American commercial banks, with $209 billion in total assets at the end of last year, according to the FDIC.
  
**Why did it fail?**
  
In short, SVB encountered a classic run on the bank. Yet, it was a confluence of cumulative events over the past few years that set the stage for SVB’s rapid demise. Indeed, several forces collided to take down the banker for tech startups.
  
First, there was the Federal Reserve, which began raising interest rates a year ago to tame inflation. The Fed moved aggressively, and higher borrowing costs derailed the highflying tech stocks that had fueled and benefited SVB. Basically, SVB’s failure was an unintended consequence of 2022 tech stock crash.
  
Higher interest rates pretty much destroyed the value of long-term bonds that SVB had gobbled up during the era of ultra-low, near-zero interest rates. SVB used these ultra-low interest bonds to help finance high growth tech startups. But when the tech tide went out in 2022, SVB was sitting on a ton of low yielding debt. SVB’s $21 billion bond portfolio was yielding a lowly 1.79% — the current 10-year Treasury yield is about 3.9%.
  
At the same time, venture capital began drying up, forcing startups to draw down funds held by SVB. So the bank was sitting on a mountain of unrealized losses in bonds just as the pace of customer withdrawals was escalating.
  
**Then the panic hit…**
  
On Wednesday, SVB announced it had sold a bunch of securities at a loss, and that it would also sell $2.25 billion in new shares to shore up its balance sheet. This set off alarm bells all over Wall Street. SVB’s attempt to raise such a huge amount of cash, shortly after selling a significant amount of securities at a loss, triggered a panic among key venture capital firms, who reportedly advised companies to withdraw their money from the bank immediately.
  
The bank’s stock began plummeting Thursday morning, and by the afternoon it was dragging other bank shares down with it. This situation was just a little too familiar, and investors began to fear a potential repeat of the 2007-2008 financial crisis. By Friday morning, trading in SVB shares was halted and it had abandoned efforts to quickly raise capital or find a buyer. California regulators intervened, shutting the bank down and placing it in receivership under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
  

  
**What’s next?**
  
Smaller banks that are disproportionately tied to capital-intensive industries like tech and crypto may be in for a rough ride, according to Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.
  
“Everyone on Wall Street knew that the Fed’s rate-hiking campaign would eventually break something, and right now it looks like the chickens are finally come home to roost,” Moya said on Friday.
  
The FDIC typically sells a failed bank’s assets to other banks, using the proceeds to repay depositors whose funds weren’t insured.",1,stocks

It would be like setting up a bakery where the government sets a price cap on the price of a loaf of bread at $1.00, but the current market prices of flour, yeast, etc needed to make a loaf of bread is $2.00. 

Or, if a more recent example is more you're speed, the Feb 2021 Winter Storm Uri freeze in Texas is another good example - Texas state regulators mandate a max price cap on the price of electricity to consumers, which, we can all agree is a good thing, as electricity and power are basic utilities Texans need to survive and go about their daily lives. That being said, a similar scenario took place where **the inputs need to create electricity** (namely natural gas) *did not* have any sort of price cap. So what happened is 
 
1.  we saw a huuuuuge windfall for companies that produce natural gas and sell it in the spot market (Energy Transfer and Kinder Morgan) but 

2. the (unhedged) buyers of that natural gas / sellers of electricity (residential electric utilities) became insolvent pretty quickly when the price of electricity you're selling is fixed and the price of the natural gas you need to produce said electrify **is not**.

Like, why start a business in the first place if there are regulatory mechanisms in place that prevent the owner from earning any sort of return on his or her invested capital? 

**Aside**: this really only applies to the bakery example above, not so much the Feb '21 Winter Freeze since those mechanisms are designed to protect consumers (which is good and an appropriate role for the government to serve in the context of free markets, but with insanely huge barriers to entry in the form of upfront capital spend)......but on the other hand, it also exposes smaller, undercapitalized utilities to a lot of Black Swan-like risk, especially if those smaller utilities are doing a shitty job of managing their commodity risk by lack of price hedges",1,Economics

Last time there was a run on an actual federal depository holding money for regular joes (and not non-boutique / specialty bank like SVB that lends to a very very small subset of borrowers), it was a private citizen, JP Morgan (the guy, not the bank), that had to save the banking system by way of a personal bailout to save the burgeoning financial system in the United States in 1907.

Edit: More info below on the Panic of 1907

&gt;In the summer of 1907, the American economy was showing signs of weakness as a number of business and Wall Street brokerages went bankrupt. In October, the respected [Knickerbocker Trust in New York City](https://devastatingdisasters.com/the-knickerbocker-trust-company-and-the-new-york-bank-panic-1907/) and the [Westinghouse Electric Company](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/252812) both failed, touching off a series of events known as the Panic of 1907.

&gt;In the wake of the initial business collapses, stock market prices plummeted and depositors made a massive run on the nation’s banks. The U.S. Treasury pumped millions of dollars into weak banks in the hope of saving them, but the string of collapsed institutions lengthened.

&gt;In a reprise of his role during the second Cleveland administration when the gold standard was under assault, J.P. Morgan acted to restore order. He summoned the leading bankers and financial experts to his home where they set up shop in his library. Over the course of the next three weeks, Morgan and his associates labored to channel money from the strong institutions to the weaker ones in an effort to keep them afloat.

&gt;The joint effort of the government and the business leaders improved conditions markedly over the course of several weeks. While the crisis passed, the finger-pointing began. Reform elements of both political parties believed that the American banking system was fundamentally flawed and needed wholesale change. Business leaders, however, held that Roosevelt's progressive legislation had upset the natural order of the economy and the government should stop its meddling.

&gt;Following the Panic of 1907, the reform elements gradually gained the upper hand. An emerging consensus affirmed that thorough bank reform was necessary to provide badly needed currency elasticity (a major issue in the Panic) and the general soundness of the banking system. Congress responded by passing stop-gap legislation, the [Aldrich-Vreeland Act (1908)](https://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h953.html), until more thorough actions could be prepared.

&gt;With the passing of the [Owen-Glass Federal Reserve Act of 1913](https://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1052.html), the Federal Reserve System was created. The ""Fed"" was designed to be flexible and responsive to the economy and independent of politics. The Fed has evolved through the years by implementing many strict checks and balances. New departments, the General Accounting Office, GAO, and the Office of Management &amp; Budget, OMB, were created to audit the Fed and most other government departments. As a result, the American economy, and American society are more stable.",5,Economics

Cash is a liability for banks -- they want it to be invested, not held. Reduce the reserve requirement and of course they will invest the cash -- which is fine -- except for when your entire business model depends on liquidity. And then you invest too much into ""super safe"" -- but illiquid -- assets. And then someone wants more than the cash you have on hand -- which you invested way beyond what would be considered safe for your normal liquidity. And now you have to take your ""super safe"" assets to the pawn shop because you need cash now.  And -of course- the pawn shop isn't gonna give you 1:1 value.

Bonds are safe only when you can hold them to maturity. The second you need to offload them, you are suddenly at the mercy of the market.

How many city's shit themselves when a corporation's back up their offices and move else where, and the local company's no longer have spenders? Back 40 years ago it was much worse, look at Seattle and Boeing back then, small company's lived and breathed off that airplane money. The only difference between that and today is change 1 company for a massive number of smaller ones.

If multiple tech firms (doubt Roku will, but small and medium MSP/MSSP's or application shops) go belly up, this results in those jobs going away, if they don't find new jobs they very well might leave, if they leave houses hit the market for sale (flooding it). Also, no jobs in that local area means many small businesses will die because who is gonna buy $25 ramen in a fancy bowl?

Basically it could domino for the entire tech market. On the upside, anyone with cash who wanted these firms, expect a fire sale if the FDIC can't recover the cash. Don't forget the federal reserve has been wanting a economic down turn, if rates were to raise again, this would further devalue those bonds, and the threat of more rate hiking would push them lower, which massively decreases any chance of getting the assets back for those above the FDIC insurance rate.

I'm all for making banks do more to protect customers (whether those are corporate customers, as was mostly the case here, or individual customers).  But, you can't reasonably expect them to voluntarily do it, because doing so will put them out of business.  That's why you need laws and regulations.  
  
As far as we can tell from the facts of SVB so far, they weren't doing anything fraudulent and they weren't violating any regulations.  They may have been operating in a less than optimal manner in how they held assets.  
  
When it comes to those bonds, yes, the bank needed to raise some more capital to cover a position they were losing money on, but that happens all the time.  It's part of risk.  They were likely over invested in them, but that didn't cause the bank to fail.  What caused the bank to fail was VC doing what VC does, and that's fuck up everything they touch.  
  
As far as interest rates go, we've been in an artificial economy since 2008, and arguably even earlier due to interest rates that have been far too low.  There's a good chunk of Reddit whose entire adult lives have been spent under suppressed interest rates, myself included to boost the economy.  And they've needed to change that for a long time.  
  
The first serious attempt to do that happened under Obama at the end of his second term (so about 5 years after it should have happened), then Trump immediately had that undone.  Raising rates is the responsible thing to do, but higher rates hits VC hard, and tech is hugely reliant on VC, so the tech sector is taking a big hit as rates go up, as it drastically changes the business model of how tech companies operate.  
  
A bank like SVB, which mostly works with tech companies and tech workers is going to be hit hard when that happens.  And you're right, they should have known that.  But, rates have been going up for a year now, so I'm pretty sure they have known that, and have been adjusting.",2,news

jbwgli0,11nu8oc,2023-03-12 06:31:13,binaryghost01,"I have seen a lot of comments discussing the financial perspective of this event but none whatsoever talking about why this could have potentially happened to the actual tech industry and the startups that are in the eye of the storm.

I read something like the following on this post.

&gt;The government needed something to take the fall and SVB was picked.

I very much interpret it as.

&gt;A bubble had to be popped. Popped a bubble was. Bubbles tends to pop.

Let's be honest, this wouldn't happen under no circumstance if the technology industry was still healthy and nurturing profit to everyone's pockets.

I personally think that Web 2.0 is an old concept of technology and it very much represents all of these startups being voraciously funded by VCs even if in their very essence, these startups represent very questionable projects in the hand of even more questionable leadership.

Web 2.0 today is very much a bunch of SaaS solutions being pushed down the throat of companies and consumers without providing a truly innovative or disruptive value as they did some years ago with the advent of social networks, payment platforms, transportation apps, hospitality solutions... Silicon Valley is lacking ideas and creativity for some time now. While the true disruptors have been nurturing innovation in Web 3.0 (blockchains/decentralized economy) and AI economy.

Silicon Valley as we know became an inflated money machine that is not delivering the same amount of value to society as it used to. They couldn't sustain the immense amount of investment they have been receiving because they were not being able to actually market these products and make a solid profit out of them.

My two cents is that all of this will kickstart the true adoption of the decentralized economy (crypto) because as the panic spreads and grow, people will once again realize that they never really owned their money and that even though banks promise only one fundamental thing (trust), they are not always able to provide that. Just like history has shown in the past. The main difference is that now there is an actual alternative to true monetary ownership. Welcome to the age of true autonomy and financial freedom.",1,news

Remember Theranos? They don't hold a candle to this other scam bank.

This is going to bring down every company involved with SVB. Take for example companies such as video game maker Roblox Corp RBLX.N and streaming device maker Roku Inc (ROKU.O) said they had hundreds of millions of deposits at the bank.

As a C-corp if you miss payroll you open yourself up to broader liabilities which can pierce corporate veil as well. This means if the payroll needs are higher than what depositors will have access to, BKs can happen.

The upside is there's been a lot of action in bridge loans and other financial instruments to hopefully avoid some of that. It's going to be a tenuous situation though I'm a bit more optimistic than when I posted 2 days prior (the interconnectedness of ecosystem is what worried me most). Startups with too high a burn are going to have a rough time getting access to follow on funding though, so regardless of how quickly depositors are made whole (and I do think they will be, with some delay) SVB disappearing leaves a mark that will not be easily remedied -- capital markets for startups were already tightening before this and will tighten a lot further, leading to some faster than usual seed and series A companies churning out.",1,news

The bad management here was in buying long bonds that were losing value today, but would \*eventually\* turn a profit. That's fine, as long as 1/4 of your customers don't panic and pull all their money out in a day, which they did. The only people who were ""smart"" and got their money out \*caused\* the failure by taking all their money out. If they don't do that none of this happens.

These industries depend on constantly borrowing money from VC (venture capitalists).  The increase in interest rates caused these firms to not be able to borrow as much as they needed to sustain operations SO…like most people..they started using the money in their bank accounts.  This typically is not so dramatic of an impact on a bank to cause them to be unable to meet their reserve requirements. Because ALL of the depositors were having the same cash flow prob and all had their money in one bank &amp; that bank had little OTHER customers-it did what I said.  The customers removed so much cash that the bank then needed to sell assets or borrow to make the (I think) $2 million shortfall it needed to prevent a takeover for insolvency by the FDIC. Now, at the same time this happened, the bank president announced the losses and the need to shore up its reserves (not unusual-typical transparency to stockholders during an earnings call).  Well, the venture capitalists and fin advisors who were ON that call then started telling all of their clients to get their money out and….you can figure out from there.

Meanwhile, on the other side of things, the bank had a majority of its assets in bonds which are inversely related to interest rates so…rates go up and bond prices go down. The bank’s first choice of raising money was to sell its assets BUT the market was not the best time so…they didn’t get as much as they needed and now none of those VC’s were willing to lend them money…so…deadline came and they didn’t have the required funds and the FDIC declared them insolvent and took over which is what is required.",1,news

This is partially right. You are absolutely wrong as to why people withdrew the money. 40 billion in a single day being withdrawn is not because bonds were at 5 percent. You are trying to downplay the fact that 40 billion was withdrawn in a single fucking day. **This was 40 billion before the FDIC shut the bank down. It could have been way more.** People do not panic withdraw that much fucking money to buy bonds.


&gt; Basically the bank fucked up. Trump also cut a lot of regulations for "" community banks "" which also could have prevented this from happening.

Every bank is vulnerable to a mass bank run, period. The bank would need near liquid assets at a 1:1 ratio of deposits to cover a full bank run, then they would also need money left over for operations, investments, etc. This regulation may have prevent it, it may not have prevented it. The FDIC stopped the bank before the run could harm the remaining assets. The bank run could have easily went into the 100 billion range with the type of members they have.

If the CEO or other executives inappropriately sold shares with knowledge that the bank was insolvent, the SEC should and likely will get involved. Perhaps the shareholders will also sue. That remains to be seen.

Aside from that, incompetence is not illegal. If someone messes up at their job, they’ll likely be fired, but the company doesn’t claw back past wages. If there is fraud or other illegal activity there may be legal penalties. But we don’t put people in jail or claw back wages for being incompetent.

This is not an Enron situation where there was massive fraud and the money is simply gone. It’s just that their assets weren’t liquid enough to cover withdrawals so they became insolvent. The reason the feds stepped in is because in a situation where a firm is insolvent you need a third party to take control of assets and distribute funds to depositors.

As an investor seeking yield, you have almost no reason to use banks right now, which have all these low-rate baggage from pre-2022 and can't compete with treasuries. The fed must probably address this soon if they want to keep interest rate higher for longer, potentially by re-thinking interest on reserves, or ideally providing the capability for people to hold digital dollars risk free directly which is a special privilege only banks have right now.

They provide risky collateral through a promise from VC funds. If you open a business in Chase, they would want a solid business plan with tangible collateral and verifications of all income source. Yet, a startup at SVB can use the promise of future VC funding as collateral. That is the very definition of greedy high risk.

jc0xwmd,11pffw9,2023-03-13 06:09:19,SassyMoron,"It's true that FDIC only insures accounts under 250k. However, they take banks into receivership well before uninsured depositors get hurt, most of the time.


To a bank, deposits are liabilities. Other liabilities the bank may have include bonds theyve issued and other money they've borrowed. The banks assets include loans they've given and financial instruments they've purchased. Think of it like piling up blocks. When you stack up all of the banks assets, and stack up all the liabilities next to that, the asset stack needs to be taller than the liability stack. 


If the liability stack is getting too high/the asset stack is getting too low, the FDIC notices that. They can step in and take.over if the stacks are.getting too close together. That's taking a bank into receivership. They then pair off blocks from the two piles. Hopefully at the end they still have some asset blocks left over. If not, then some of the blocks on the liability side represent people who gave the bank money and aren't getting all of it back. 


Now, when you stack the liability blocks, insured deposits go way down at the bottom. Next up are uninsured depositors. On top of them are people who've lent the bank money or bought its bonds. For an uninsured depositor to lose.momey, it means all those liabilities above it got wiped out. The FDIC tries to step in before that happens. 


Of course this is a simplification. Sometimes banks tie a specific liability to a specific asset (eg they get a mortgage when they build a new bank branch). Those people will ""jump the line"" and get that asset even if everyone else is losing money. But basically that's how it works.",1,news

So of *course* they'll say the rent/mortgage shouldn't bounce because they can hit you for more fees with every additional overdraft.

One of the reasons I like my credit union is I could actually call them in a rare emergency where my checking account would overdraft with a few transactions pending, and just say ""look, I'll pay a fee for it, just please don't ding me multiple times, everything will be settled within 48 hours.""

Ultimately while unlikely, this is something that could happen to you. If everyone who has money at the bank your employer uses decides to withdraw it all at the same time your employers bank doesn't have enough cash on hand to pay it all out all at once and now your employer doesn't have the money to pay you this month, your employer doesn't pay it's utilities or rent, you're employer can go under or have to cut costs unexpectedly &amp; now you get fucked over.

I think Jan 6 was abhorrent on the face of it. But I don't know the details beyond a cursory glance. Needless to say though - ""Don't storm the fucking Capitol"" seems like a solid ground to stand on.

I also think it needs to go a little deeper than just Jan 6th. Your civilization is a system. It's not either Republican or Democrat. It's BOTH Republican and Democrat. And we've seen the social fabric continue to degrade (slowly, and then suddenly, as so often is the case in the world) over the last ~20 years.

Americans are no longer civil with each other. And that much is obvious from an outsiders perspective. Your language in your initial comment is emblematic of the strains I mention. Regardless of what you may want to think of ""the other side"", you're with them. And they're with you. And your civilization will do better if it can work well together. 

It's a hard pill to swallow, but human psychology and human systems are all self-reinforcing. It's in our nature to reciprocate. For the good or the bad. And I just don't see a lot of ""aiming up"" and ""working well together"" going on anymore. I worry that before long there will be *irreconcilable differences*.

A lot of the conversation is already leading to fighting. And when there's fighting, it'll lead to the rise of fighters. And once you get fighters in charge, you'll have a fight.

Banning of books and ideas. I don't know enough about this and without knowing more I don't know how to comment.

I don't know Peter Thiel all that well. Mostly from his business ventures. And I'm aware that he's a proponent of using Rene Girard's Mimetic Theory to guide his thinking, with the aim to reduce the likelihood of violence.

As to his political donations. Given the state of the American political system at the moment, I'm not sure it would be possible to elevate a truly ""good"" candidate. As is so often the case in human decision making, he may find himself making the best choice out of a bad bunch of options. This could be a value assessment he's making. (And could be failing at it as we all are subject to doing in our lives.)

Perhaps I'm just being too charitable. But in general, as an outsider, the American system seems a bit too disorderly at the moment, and I'm not convinced there are good options.

I want nothing more than for everyone there to realize the other side isn't going anywhere, and just like with your spouse - fighting and winning isn't really winning.",3,technology

It’s sort of like buying a stock while the price is a little on the high side, then the company has a rough year and their stock goes down. It’s not worthless, it’ll probably recover, but it’s no good right now unless you want to eat the loss. That WOULD cause SVB to lose depositors money.

Because depositors panicked and started trying to withdraw billions all at once SVB simply had no way of converting its assets back into cash quickly enough. That caused more panic, which made the situation worse. 

SVB absolutely has always had cash and other assets (bonds) with enough value to cover everyone. They just couldn’t convert assets quickly enough to deal with the panicked withdrawals. 

That is why the government stepped in and why it’s relatively easier to make people whole. The federal government has the cash to handle the customers, and it can afford to hold on to the bonds. They’ll either take payments from the various cities and states that issued them or wait for the market to shift and sell them off. Taxpayers aren’t going to foot the bill.",1,stocks

The original formulation of NTS was regarding someone claiming that someone of poor moral character is not a true Scotsman. Being morally upright is not a defining characteristic of being a Scotsman in the first place. 

Compare to, for example, Christianity, where definitionally a Christian has a set number of characteristics that define being one, and no other characteristics do. If you see a self-identified Christian who, say, smokes, and claim that they're not a true Christian, that's a NTS fallacy, because there is no commandment against smoking, regardless of whether you personally approve or disapprove of smoking. But if a self-identified Christian denies that they believe that Jesus was the son of God, *the* fundamental tenet, then you can absolutely say that they're not a true Christian. 

Saying that someone isn't a true X for doing something that is by definition incompatible with being X is not fallacious.

In this case, regardless of one's stance on bailouts, saying that someone is not a true libertarian for being pro bailout is a valid claim, as it represents government intervention and distortion in the free market, the primary tenet that libertarians are defined by opposing. 

Of course, on the point of the thread, I'd argue that there basically are no real libertarians, because in my experience those who identify as one are almost universally self-interested, hypocritical bastards who exhibit this exact ""socialism for me but not for thee"" behavior when push comes to shove. There are very few in this bunch that don't show their asses and reveal themselves to just be cronyists when they get the chance. I've met a few genuinely principled libertarians in my time, but most who call themselves as such either hunt for a handout that they allegedly abhor as soon as they want one, or are just ""I'm literally a neo-feudalist or a fascist, but I think weed is cool"" dudes.",9,Economics
jc3cm7q,11q9jlk,2023-03-13 19:09:51,VeteranSergeant,"&gt; Nozick's idea of government was mimarchism. A strong but limited government which maintains public goods.

Which is why we make fun of it.  Nobody is suggesting all libertarians are suggesting anarchy or otherwise complete lack of a state, only that their concept of a ""minimalist government"" wouldn't actually be functional to the degree that it would be able to carry out the necessary functions it would require. The only people who take Nozick seriously are, unsurprisingly, other libertarians caught in the same closed-loop rationalization that revolves around the unprovable assertion that individual rights supersede all other rights. Nozock also insists that like-minded localized groups are an effective regulator of the greater public good. Again, something that only works if you live in a pre-industrial, pre-globalized world.  Which, unfortunately for Nozick, none of us do.  Even the most isolated anarchist commune is still stuck on Earth with the rest of us and will suffer whatever eventual outcomes are inflicted on the climate, for example. It's a short-sighted view for people with short-term individualist objectives. Or, in other words, the ideal philosophy for selfish and greedy people.

Though perhaps I should have been more broad in my definition. Not all libertarians are selfish and greedy. Plenty of them are just so poorly educated that they fall for the nice-sounding platitudes like ""self ownership,"" not realizing that they're just being manipulated by the people set to most greatly and directly profit from reduced government.",0,Economics

jc3fima,11q9jlk,2023-03-13 19:28:24,Paganator,"The fundamental flaw of libertarianism, IMHO, is that it's based on the just-world fallacy. That's the idea that the world is fair and that people get what they deserve. Therefore the people who get the most success must be superior in some ways to others.

This popular worldview vastly underestimates the effects of random events in our lives. Good and bad events that are out of our control change our lives in huge ways that our actions can't compensate for. A simple thought exercise illustrates this well.

Let's say you have two rival companies in a market, A and B. They're perfect clones of each other: neither is better than the other at anything. And let's say there are two available contracts for them, a small one and a big one. The small contract pays barely enough to keep the company handling it running, while the big one is very profitable and will fund growth.

Since the two companies are clones, neither is better able to handle the large contract. It ends up being random which company gets which contract. Let's say company A gets the small contract and B gets the big one. At the end of the year, A hasn't grown while B was able to hire more employees and purchase better tools.

Next year, similar contracts become available: a small one and a big one. Now the competition isn't equal. B is clearly the better company since it has more resources and experience working on big contracts. So, again, A gets the small contract and doesn't grow, while B gets the large one and grows even bigger.

The same kind of contract appears in the third year. Now, company B is large enough to handle both contracts at the same time. Company A fails to get any work and goes bankrupt.

So why did company A fail while B prospered? Libertarians would tell you it's because company B was run better and A deserved its failure. But that isn't the case. We established at the start that both companies were equal in every way.

The reason A failed and B took over is just luck, the consequence of the random decision to choose B for the first large contract even though A was equally competent.

This is a thought experiment with a single event but in reality, we live in a chaotic world with thousands of factors out of our control affecting us. Being in the right place at the right time has much more impact on success. The libertarian idea that people get what they deserve is an illusion.",4,Economics

“”expend money with the expectation of achieving a profit or material result by putting it into financial plans, shares, or property, or by using it to develop a commercial venture””

I’ve never met a true libertarian that cries for government help when their independence goes south. That’s the whole point. In fact many have small startup funds to help their community during losses, they just don’t want to contribute to a wide government fund that spends their moneys in ways they don’t support. I also think libertarians make it a point to educate themselves on the system (especially economic) entirely because it’s more of a philosophy than a political platform, and in order to be credible at all you have to be aware of that. Most of what libertarians espouse about the market and federal reserve isn’t even remotely ignorant or an example of misunderstanding. 

It’s also not a lack of trust in everyone else (which is a major misunderstanding on your end), it’s actually quite the opposite. Libertarians put a lot of trust in their community because they value it’s ability to take care of one another over the government. They completely oppose bailouts- so no, no libertarians are crying for socialization of losses.

I’m a part of a $5 libertarian charity club that raises money every time someone posts a story about someone’s house being burned down, falling ill, etc. It’s raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for these people.

First was my concern about moral hazard and second was the cause of SVB’s failure. Join me and let’s revisit to clear up your confusion. The lines of credit issue is tied to my concern about moral hazard and whether banks would seemingly have no rails on who they lend to, given there is seemingly no risk on the depositor’s side. But mulling it over, the rail is the bank went to zero, the management was fired even though they gave themselves a nice pay day, and investors and bond holders were wiped out. However, I would raise the issue of the perks and incentives depositors and VCs received to bank with SVB. If there is zero risk for depositers, then there is nothing to stop banks from offering more generous perks and incentives. Someone suggested that companies should pay for extra insurance (over the FDIC limit) to earn the return of those generous perks and guaranteed backstop if the bank fails. 

Paragraph two was about the root cause of SVB’s failure, which, again for the third time, was their failure to risk manage their capital and hedge against rising rates and locked their cash in 10+ year long securities that dropped in value after the fed hiked rates.

If Assets &gt; Liabilities, and it was a cash flow issue, why didn't someone offer to buy the bank? 

Because equity is negative. Liabilities &gt; assets.

&gt;That's because a bank's largest assets (their loans and non-cash holdings) are not immediately liquid. They'd need to sell those to fund a significant run on the bank and if withdrawals exceed the pace of sale of those assets then they have a liquidity issue.

The people the government is at odds with in the tech sector are the company leaders, rather than the masses of people who are on their payrolls.  Most of the folks that would be burned from the SVB failure would be people who work for small business owners in the tech sector.  If the government does bail out SVB's depositors, I hope they pay them directly (rather than giving the money to SVB to dole out).

jc4qerg,11psj8d,2023-03-14 00:48:36,Termin8tor,"Well yeah this is the thing. I'm a developer, different country and not for a startup. I always considered startups to be a high risk venture. I've avoided them for the relative ""safety"" of corporate where possible.

If a company doesn't have risk management I avoid them like the plague.

You're probably right about layoffs incoming soon in SV in particular. Other banks tend not to deal with high risk startups.

I think the lesson here is to be cautious during periods of high inflation and rising rates. The logical thing to do as a worker is seek stable institutions for employment. As for business owners, it's to vet financial partners, whether they are banks, clients on credit terms or whatever.

The point is since several trillion dollars were injected into the U.S economy it was pretty obvious that the benchmark rate would have to rise eventually to keep a lid on inflation. It was crazy to think interest rates would remain low forever, even in the face of massive QE right?

In our personal finance people tend to engage in risk management. You might lend John some money and then later on go to the store, you're thinking about buying a TV and you think ""Can I afford my bills if I buy this? Well John will pay me back so yeah I can"" then John doesn't pay you back and you're boned. So maybe instead you think ""You know what, I'll wait until I've been paid back. If I don't get paid back soon, no big."". It's a really crap analogy but you probably get what I mean. It's risk management.

It's pretty crazy that people blindly accept high risk relationships in startups in particular. Just like in software development, you want to avoid single points of failure and build in redundancy where possible. Finances are the same.

I'm assuming you're an employee. It might be worth talking to your bosses about what their risk management strategy is in their financial relationships. If there isn't one, consider other opportunities before one day you wake up and they're gone or can't make payroll.

If you're in a decision making roll, definitely divest your banking and use safer institutions and consider keeping multiple payroll accounts to ensure that employee pay is kept insured.

&gt;I still don’t think we, as a business, could’ve seen any of this coming, esp not happening within 36 hrs.

I get you. That's the thing though. If you're not looking out for danger as a business then you won't see it. It's not necessarily about the timing either.

The analogy I can think of on this is a house fire. If you take precautions against a fire let's say, sprinkler systems, extinguishers, smoke alarms and escape plans then if there ever is a fire, there's a way to mitigate the damage or prevent it taking hold in the first place.

The analogy with SVB and it's clients would be that the clients didn't even bother with smoke alarms so they had no idea there was a fire raging in the next room over.

If you don't prepare for the possibility, the speed of the disaster will take you by surprise.

If you don't have risk assessments then you may not know it's even a possibility right? Part of risk assessment is identifying the risks.",1,technology

https://youtu.be/GdfYnqyu7v8?t=192

He does not go as far as I will in saying: this stinks. Given that some of these VCs where invested in SVB, I feel that when we follow the money well will find either incredible ineptitude, and/or some combination of duplicity and fraud. Time will tell.

Then there are the actions of these firms themselves irrespective of their VCs (which most often sit on the board and have a ton of control, which is obviously a conflict of interest for reasons that are becoming evident). 

These depositors took no real efforts to limit counterparty risk. Firms are supposed to be incentivized to manage their risk. They have been told for months and arguably years that interests rates were rising.

Take for example Roku. Roku had 26% of its cash with SVB.
This is extremely sloppy. I am seeing comments from people who work in this area that say even to top 4 largest banks in the US would be limited to deposits no more than $50m at their firms.

What do Roku and other similar companies learn from this? Save money by not managing risk, risk is managed by everyone else.

The trend is that none of these companies where doing their due diligence, such as any kind of additional due diligence (this company had open financial statements where this could be seen), insurance or hedging they should have been doing. What kind of business is Roku running that they had no risk management on over $400M?

Then there is this insurance itself. As it relates to the lack of due diligence.
this opinion takes it to the next level and argues all deposit insurance is bad.

Lots of small mom&amp;pop type places couldn't pay their employees last Friday simply because their processor used a bank that used SVB. That's thousands of companies affected without even being direct customers as SVB.

Third off off... do yo not realize how our entire society work, you quite literally would most likely not be alive if companies didn't work by running in the red in early stages. If the world worked the way you want it to where companies aren't allowed to spend more than they make, we wouldn't have modern computing, cell phones, many medicines are created this way too. The damn ships that came from europe to america operated this way too. 

It's literally how society works, these companies were spending money they raised and put in a bank. If you have EVER used credit for anything including things like a car and house you're just as guilty as these companies of spending money you don't have.

I have a feeling you have no real clue how innovation has happened in modern society, and without the basic concept of raising money and investing for future gains accessible by people how much innovation would have been stifled. Reddit is this, Microsoft was this, Apple was this, Google was this. So you're literally benefiting from the basic concept of investment innovation by the mere fact you both have access to reddit and own a device capable of using the internet.

I'd hate to live in a world where investments were not allowed. If these companies actually ran out of money and went of out business because they couldn't raise more? Fair game. Having the money their literally already had taken away from them because a bank couldn't forecast correctly and collapsed? That undermines the way our world works and would lead to a worse of future.

If you want to argue people make too much money? Fine, argue for salary caps, higher taxes, wealth taxes, etc... But saying this guy you know should lose his $250k/year by making sure he and his six employees are all 100% out of a job is not the way.

Something clearly went down, and it was more of an engineered attack on Fed/interest rates and a side of consolidation/shakeout of startup banking and investments/companies.

[“If your definition is government intervention to prevent private losses, then this is certainly a bailout,"" said Neil Barofsky, who oversaw the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the far-reaching bailout that saved the banking industry during the 2008 financial crisis.”](https://www.npr.org/2023/03/13/1163180140/silicon-valley-bank-is-it-a-bailout-barofsky)

SVB is small potatoes, the bailout wasn’t for the bank, it is a bailout of all of the depositors who were uninsured by FDIC. FDIC is absolutely not intended to be misused in this way, they are guaranteeing the deposits in full solely because they belong to the wealthy and corporations. 

Also, the bonds the government is taking as collateral are losing assets. They are bonds taken out at an interest rate well below the rate of inflation. They are the definition “troubled assets”, they will never make money and are the reason the bank had zero liquidity.

https://prospect.org/economy/2023-03-13-silicon-valley-bank-bailout-deregulation/

… SVB did not have a CRO (Chief Risk Officer) for over a year.

This phrase is not appropriate to apply when it comes to the gov stepping in to assure that uninsured deposits are not put at risk. The money in people’s savings accounts is backed by longer term bonds. The money is there, but not liquid. THIS IS HOW ALL BANKS WORK. If depositors’ money were suddenly at risk we’d see a flood of money move away from regional banks, and dozens of banks would collapse.

Chase and BofA are salivating over the idea of folks fleeing their regional banks to head for “higher ground” in all of this. It’s a win win for them… they either get to buy into smaller banks at a great price, or see their coffers swell at an insane rate. You bet your britches that JPM Chase got a screaming deal on first republic equity in the agreement they struck yesterday. 

If regional banks are allowed to completely collapse (meaning savings account are put at risk), big brand banks’ deposits would swell and those institutions would forever remain “too big to fail,” and we’d never see one of those banks unwound if there were ever a similar liquidity crisis bc it would be too risky to the global economy to let the cookie crumble any other way than to step in and keep the doors open / protect investors.

jc8dwar,11r2fip,2023-03-15 01:01:34,NotTheBatman,"More short term treasuries would have been the correct answer. Their yield at the time was lower than long term bonds, but their exposure to interest rate hikes is much lower. They would never have had to take a 20%+ haircut on a 1 or 2 year bill like they would on a 10+ year bond. The unrealized loss or gain on a treasury decreases toward zero as it approaches maturity, so even 5 year notes that were purchased 2-3 years ago would have retained much of their value at this point.

Banks should **always** make laddered purchases when buying bonds, because their entire purpose is supposed to be their ability to generate liquidity for customers on demand. Making a huge amount of amount of money in a short period of time and then sinking it all into long term treasuries was just a boneheaded move. I can't even say it was greedy, because the only way it would have made them more money than other investment strategies is if rates stayed at zero for the next decade, and the potential upside in that scenario is still tiny.

Every bank has some level of exposure to a bank run panic, but you'll never have 100% of your customers demanding all their money all at once. As long as your balance sheet is healthy enough to calm the smart money you're going to be fine, that's why no one is worried about JPM or BoA going under right now.",5,Economics

Were these people getting stupid high returns on their deposits? Basically, were these people getting returns which were ""too good to be true"" and thus should have been well aware they were ""enjoying"" high levels of risk.

For example, in my area one of their ""ultra super duper savings"" accounts might get me a 0.25% return. But if a bank were to be regularly taking on risky positions, they might also be able to get higher returns (until they couldn't).

The bank almost exclusively banked with businesses (mostly startups and businesses that used to be startups). $250K is a lot for an individual to keep in an account but it's not much at all for a company that has employees/vendors/rent to pay.

&gt;Were these people getting stupid high returns on their deposits?

Exactly why startups chose to bank at SVB is not really that clear, though currently it seems the primary reasons are a combination of: 

1. It was a condition of their loan from SVB 
2. Their VCs told them to; or 
3. Everybody else they knew in startups was banking at SVB so they just followed the crowd and assumed that if everyone was doing something it was probably a good idea.

SVB also apparently offered some startup specific perks like networking opportunities and free credits with cloud computing providers (AWS, Azure, etc.) which may have also swayed some companies to deposit with them over competitors.",3,Economics

While I appreciate (and giggled at) your sentiment, yeah, you have to follow the platform. So many democrats and republicans vote down the ticket because they continue to hope that the party will behave as it says it will (or sadly, because they just don't want the other guy to win). Furthermore, Spike Cohen, whom I mentioned, was the Libertarian presidential candidate two cycles ago. He was effectively the foremost Libertarian politician and effectively the Libertarian authority when he spoke those words, just as Biden is the democrat authority, and Trump (sadly) was the authority for the Republican party when he was in power. My point is, not all democrats think alike, not all republicans think alike and not all libertarians think alike; no general group of people all think alike, etc... Ideas exist in any group that seem good to some while remaining wholly unsavory to the rest of that group (or outsiders).

or maybe the ability to build roads is determined by a consortium of local businesses who share the cost, and when the current company fails to provide a competitive price and quality of service, they lose the contract the next time the lease is up.

vs currently where infrastructure rots away because the government is too busy pissing away their budget on frivolous bullshit.

you're too narrow minded.

&gt;Also, if the price isn’t higher, why the hell would a business want to own and run a road if they aren’t making money?

so there's some arbitrary value currently set at how much the government pays for roads that nobody will do the job for less?

have you considered that there may be even MORE money available to fund infrastructure if it wasn't fighting for funding with a million government programs with marginal value?

&gt;I have no idea why you keep glossing over that a business needs profit, the government does not.

you're missing the entire point. profit vs not profit makes literally no difference. any money the government ""loses"" is paid by the taxpayers.

&gt;Plus, who the hell is going to compete with the US interstate system? It’s build cost alone is estimated at half a trillion dollars in todays money and that doesn’t even include the cost of purchasing the necessary land.

who paid for it the first time? oh yeah, the taxpayers. how is it unreasonable that in a theoretical society where roads are privatized that the interstates would be funded too?

&gt;What’s your solution for that? If I take 8 different roads owned by 8 different companies on my morning commute, do I have to pay 8 different fees?

do you pay a different company for every website you visit?

you room temperature socialists have this absurd strawman of a libertarian society where everything is its own separate business that you have to pay upfront for. when you go to the doctor, do you pay the nurses, janitorial staff, doctors, receptionists individually? of course not. the same bundling of services would obviously still exist in the theoretical scenario.

You think large businesses keep their banking is thousands, possibly millions (lol) of banks to keep it all under FDIC or setup complex treasury bond ladders just for handling payroll. Btw a treasury bond ladder reduces their liquidity and is literally the mistake SVB made. Imagine if you had a bond ladder and I don't know know let's say you had to ""adjust to a new funding environment"" - you'd be screwed. All of a sudden your expenses change or you need lots of capital quickly and you're screwed because your money is tied up in bonds that just lost lots of value due to rising yields... Literally what SVB did lol. Great suggestion ""Instead of using SVB startups should do what SVB did that lead to their failure"".

Banking is an important part of the world economy and being able to safely use banks is a key tenant in our civilization as a whole. It's not lazy to trust a bank who's entire core competency is supposed to be to keep your money safe to... keep your money safe. 

&gt;The amount of money you are advocating these companies should be allowed to waste could probably fund the children’s hospital in your area for a couple of years at minimum.

Not sure why you keep bringing this up - I think you just hate startups and are glad they have any issues whether or not its their fault, regardless of what the startup does.

&gt;All this does is further disincentivize small companies from managing their risks.

Small companies shouldn't need to manage banking risks is the entire point. That is the point of our civilization to handle these things. 

Do you think a tech startup has to manage the risk of a massive drought causing food shortages that makes it so their employees starve and can't perform, therefore they should stockpile food incase of this? Or do you think we should live in a stable enough society where food isn't something companies have to deal with. You're here blaming the victims for the failure of the bank. If companies can't trust banks - then there is a massive failure in our entire system that would lead to an economic collapse.

Imagine if every company did exactly what you said and setup treasury bond ladders, what do you think happens next? Banks can no longer operate and have to close meaning no more loaning facilities exist and the ability for someone to invest in the future via loans dries up really quickly. 

Fun fact: FDIC only has so much money, in a major collapse it run out of money, are you saying we should properly manage our counterparty risk that the FDIC itself could become insolvent and figure out how to secure funds otherwise it's our own fault for not properly managing risk? Why even have the FDIC, why shouldn't everyone manage risk, including small mom&amp;pop pizza shops? 

It really seems to me like you have some vendetta against small companies. A 50 person startup shouldn't need to hire someone who even knows what counterparty risk means. But in your world every company needs this role filled, a highly paid CFO for everyone. Then you'll complain how small companies are wasting money on executives.",1,stocks

Why does that matter? Are you saying customers have an obligation to their bank to spend their money at a certain rate? If I suddenly withdraw all my money from my bank I'm doing something wrong? Cash deposits belong to the customer to use as they see fit, can you please show me a single document saying customers have an obligation to keep a certain amount of fund in the bank or risk losing it all?

It really sounds like you're apologizing for SVB's piss-poor risk management by blaming their customers. If you have money in a bank deposit - it is yours to see fit.

&gt;You know why the unemployment reports have not reflected the 200,000+ people wiped out of big tech? Because all of these poorly-managed small companies living on other people's money ran out and snatched them up and they are losing massively on that bet.

Irrelevant conversation to SVB, again if you think we should outlaw VC funding and similar ways of raising money, that is a separate conversation.

&gt;The hilarious part is that this is not really SIVB's fault,

It is completely their fault.... They knew interest rates were going up, the feds announced it, they bought long term rated bonds at low interest rates knowing they're in a volatile customer market. This is absolutely their fault. I'm almost starting to think your goal here is to excuse this bank by blaming their customers. Do you work for them or were you invested in them or something?

&gt;You know what the worst part is? This action by the Fed actually robs the workers in these businesses of their leverage to negotiate with their employers for an increase in non-cash compensation.

What? you literally think these startups should be shut down, you say that over and over that they're burning money. You know the biggest expense of any startup? payroll. Your actual position is these companies shouldn't be able to spend more money then go and say ""workers should force companies to spend more money"". I'm all for workers getting paid more, but you're right here making a complete contradiction, just a few lines above you asked why isn't unemployment higher. A few posts ago you complained about startups overpaying their executives. Which is it? Should a startup burn more money on payroll, or spend less money. Let's be consistent here.

&gt; If you are an employee of some startup and they have a liquidity crunch and you are in a position to float them for a couple or a few paychecks in exchange for more equity, you now lose that leverage.

Possibly the most contradictory statement here. You think these companies spend too much money and should go out of business, but also think their workers should put in their hard earned money into them so they can lose it too? Also most startups fail, this is extremely inadvisable advice for the average employee who can only work for one startup at a time (versus investors who can invest in many startups at a time). Lastly, many startups offer ISOs, literally nothing stops them from doing exactly what you say as we speak. They can exercise their options at any time yet they rarely do. Equity instead of salary is predominately for suckers with very few winning because as you literally have said: most startups will fail and there's a bubble with financing. I really feel like you're changing your position/argument here. Most people can't afford to float their company money, their companies are literally their livelihoods.

&gt;Government intervention causes moral hazard down the road. In the future, why wouldn't another bank work with these same customers and buy short dated options instead of Treasuries? 

I don't disagree here - the solution is stricter regulations to prevent this behavior from banks. It's good investors and creditors got wiped out with SVB, at least it wasn't a bailout. The moral hazard is reduced by the fact the investors got completely wiped out in SVB. But the banks making mistakes shouldn't hurt their customers - that's half of the entire point of financial regulations, to ensure people can safely use banks.

&gt;They could offer savings accounts yielding 20% and get tons of depositors, and then if it all blows up in their faces, the depositors get all of their money back no questions asked.

Okay but why would anyone start such a bank knowing they're going to blow up and lose 100% of their investment? SVB isn't being bailed out. Also there are regulations on how much a bank has to keep in reserve, a bank doing a 20% yield would break regulations really fast and either have to shut down or become a ponzi scheme at that moment. Basically your idea here is I should spend all the time and money to start a bank, only to give my first few customers 20% interest for at most a few months before I have to shut down and lose everything. Might as well just give money away to random companies.",1,stocks

So you're saying with this is the main mistake these companies made, was using SVB instead of say JPM to hold their cash? The preceding two paragraphs have nothing to do with bank deposits. Investments and bank deposits are not the same thing. If you think VCs should vet their portfolios better then sure whatever I can agree with that, but that has nothing to do with bank deposit risk.

So do I have that right: you think these companies deserve to fail because they didn't choose JPM over SVB for their banking and you think companies MUST be responsible for fully vetting their banks and know enough about banking rules and regulations and filings to be able to appropriately judge the health of their banks, even if it's a small 15 person startup?


&gt; How about this question. What if SVB dealt with private prison operators instead of your friendly neighborhood tech bro? Would you still feel the same way? How about if they were oil companies, or if they clubbed baby seals for a living?

Yes, yes, and yes. No matter what happens a bank failure shouldn't affect it's customers, even if the customers are evil. I'd say companies that club baby seals should be illegal as a whole, I think private prisons should be illegal too. But what I don't think is that a bank failure should affect their funds, I could agree that banks shouldn't be allowed to knowingly work with baby-seal clubbing companies  (KYC rules, just like with other crimes and drugs and etc...). And the fed should be allowed to seize funds of illegal businesses. But that is NOT the same as saying a bank failure should be allowed to indiscriminately wipe out all its customers, even if some of those customers might club baby seals.

&gt;I say all of this as someone who makes a living in tech, and have for my entire professional career. There is absolutely monumental waste everywhere in the small cap sector, and I can tell you from personal experience that some VCs don’t even ask for financials for, their portfolio companies. 

That's fine, crazy high burn rates are common in startups and I see that shit all the time, a new company burning tons of money and they fully deserve to go out of business I don't disagree with you here, it's the method you're advocating for that's the issue.


&gt; That kind of shit absolutely cannot exist because the money just gets shot into the sun and if nobody is asking any questions, then why shouldn’t the tap get shut off if the company is so incompetent that they don’t even know treasury counterparty risk exists?

Because doing so undermines the entire system that breeds innovation. You're saying these wasteful startups now have to hire people who can analyze counter party risk of large banks as soon as they get their series A. That's just going to lead to lots more waste, now every single one of these thousands of startups have to hire trained CFOs who can properly analyze counterparty risk even with a team size of like 10 people. That's incredibly inefficient versus the government regulating banks of all sizes and requiring stress tests. How many trained professionals saw SVB collapsing overnight two weeks ago? You're saying every startup has to hire people who were that insightful. If I'm a health-tech startup founder and just landed a Series A, I would now need to hire consultants/fractional CFOs to analyze the counter party risk of my bank, and these consultants/fractional CFOs would have to be more skilled than the armies of people who didn't see SVB coming, all the while managing my company of a whole 15 people.

And lastly, the SVB failure affected many companies that weren't badly run, their ONLY mistake was which bank they chose. Lots of innovative companies actually moving society forward. You're essentially throwing the baby out with the bathwater here. It's not like exclusively 100% of SVB's customers were dumb companies.

&gt;There is a placard in every bank that says FDIC insured up to $250,000. It’s not that hard. It doesn’t take a genius or a highly paid consultant to say, “what if the worst happens?” Business continuity and disaster recovery is also part of running a company.

I mean, FDIC didn't always exist, do you think everyone who lost their money in the bank failures of the great depression deserved to lose their money? Also let's keep in mind the practicalities where I think well over 85% or 90% of the money was actually available but it would take time for SVB to unwind, this means some companies could have been put out of business despite previously being break even, then months or years later get all their money back, and the owners would cash that in, the workers and their options would have been long wiped out get nothing, and whatever product they were building long dead. That's not good for the economy. SVB's failure needs to be prevented in the future with more banking regulations to make sure we keep the pace of innovation. 

A question I'd have is where does it end, you used an AWS example but should startups also make sure their office is structurally sound? (I actually worked with a company whose building literally sank into the ground, only 3 inches so no one got hurt, but enough that the building was condemned). Should they inspect their beams themselves to make sure it can withstand an earthquake, hurricane, tornado etc...? I actually my company's AWS account, is it my responsibility to make sure they're not lying to me when they say my servers are in multiple regions and AZs? Should I, a customer with only a 5-figure monthly spend, force AWS to give me tours of their facilities so they can prove to me they're real? Etc... 

BTW I'd love for you to show me a BCP that actually lists bank failures in it, maybe very large public companies have it but I have never personally seen one list their bank outright failing, or even external fund raising drying up in theirs, (I have seen how to react to a recession affecting customer demand). It's almost always about ""what if AWS goes down"", ""what if there's a natural disaster"", etc... But there's always some assumption of there being a society/government/banking system inherent in them.

Ultimately my gripe here is banking failures are incredibly rare, black swan like events, SVB failing is literally the 2nd largest in history, with the only larger one being during the very moment the entire fabric of the modern economy very nearly totally collapsed. This isn't some common risk that happens left and right, SVB was a large well respected company. A few months ago if you asked even financial experts is a bank that stores its money in mostly high quality treasury bonds was likely of collapsing overnight, you'd get a no. So you're asking startups to be smarter about finance than those guys - even if the startup's core competency isn't about finance at all.

&gt;If AWS abruptly announced it was shutting down tomorrow and never coming back, would you say someone should bail out the companies that didn’t have backups? 

Unironically yeah actually. Think about how much damage to our economy this would cause? If AWS really did shut down tomorrow and never came back, the entire GDP of the US would likely drop significantly, people would likely literally die through sheer statistics of number of services no longer available including many healthcare based companies. Now Amazon and their shareholders obviously should be completely wiped out if this happened. 

Now the reality is there's no such thing as a bailout here, it's not as straightforward or simple as a bank, if AWS went down due to technical (or even natural/unnatural disaster) type of reasons no one can just swoop in and flip a switch to keep things running for everyone.

Maybe a different answer more to the sprit of your example: The concept of a server going down and crashing is a common occurrence, anyone dealing in tech knows this. Backups are a critical step here and a known risk and part of the industry, to my comments above ""what if your cloud provider vanishes"" is a common, borderline required line in any BCP. I can find you many examples of a BCP that captures this, but still can't find a good one for bank failures. Also if AWS risk is too major nothing stops you from making your own datacenter if you really want - with banking it's actually illegal to have a bank if you do something else. Even Microsoft can't just make its own personal mini bank and start clearing its own ACH transactions as that's against the law. There is no option but to trust a bank. You earlier talked about bond ladders - great but SIPC only covers like 500k I think you still need a broker here, so is that really an answer when your broker could go out of business and only the first 500k is covered? Are you supposed to buy paper bonds and keep them in your own vault? 


&gt;Heck, at a minimum, at some point in the past year, cutting burn. Had these companies done what they should have done and managed their burn, SIVB is probably still in its original form.

It is not the responsibility of a bank's customers to keep the bank solvent, SVB failed due their failure to manage risk. If I have money in the bank, it's my money to do what I see fit with it. That's how the banking system is supposed to work. 

&gt; and all of the revolving credit and term loan facilities are back in business. The bridge bank is not even going to take a second look at their prior underwriting

Woah woah woah - are you mixing two concepts here? this entire conversation has been about bank deposits NOT revolving credit lines. Of course if SVB fails their credit lines close. Please correct me if I'm wrong but the government is NOT backstopping lines of credit and only actual bank deposits. If you're here talking about lines of credit that's a completely different argument altogether. I've been very clear with terms like ""deposits"", ""their money"", ""FDIC"", etc... that I'm talking about the cash. I would fully agree lines of credit should close and remain closed with SVB's failure. If you're talking about deposits there's no such thing as underwriting for deposits because as I've mentioned it's your money to use as you see fit.

&gt; No changes to patterns or practices anywhere, just right back to it.

Again it's your money to use as you see fit, I do think there needs to be changes to practices, the practices of the bank and how they manage their money. NOT how customers of bank use their money. Requiring all banks, not just ones with 250billion+ to follow regulations including stress tests (aka undo Trump's changes) is a small start but there's more than just that. We definitely need changes in how banks operate - specially so again, everyone has the ability to do with what is their money as they see fit.


&gt;Lastly, all of this is happening against the worst inflation episode in decades. This completely undermines what the Fed is trying to achieve by raising rates. Having a whole bunch of extra money is what got us in this mess in the first place. Now, the likely response is going to be a premature pause or a rate cut.

No disagreements there on the practicalities and implications, but we have to balance our the good versus bad here. Losing faith in the banking system could easily lead to and overall financial collapse akin to 2008 - and the response there is.... drop interest rates to 0%. Preventing contagion and future bank runs is a key step here. But the reason we may have a premature pause is NOT because companies are spending their money faster than planned it's due to banks not properly managing their risk. It's literally the rate cut's goal to have companies be able to raise less money and burn through more of it, the very thing you keep blaming companies for. However the expectation is the banks can handle that, bad companies collapse, good ones survive, our institutions are intact and we reduce inflation rate. A bank failure causes plenty of well run companies to fail as well, and that is the problem.",1,stocks

If SVB had to shop their loan book on the open market, there is no way they would get to 100% of book value. You buy things in liquidation environments at a discount, and I guarantee you that any competent buyer would be taking a look at the sample of the loans and also considering SIVB’s own statements regarding the credit risk of its depositors, and bidding accordingly. 

While I agree that a basic level of trust is required, your building example is actually a good one. If you got a penthouse for rent you would pay for a studio, you might ask yourself why this place is so far below market and then indeed start checking the structural integrity of the space? This is what happened at SVB, and you’re wrong about nobody seeing it coming. I had strongly considered shorting SVB on the basis that a company I am familiar with got a massive loan with essentially no underwriting and no ability to pay it back. I did not follow through with the plan because I ended up going longer on GOOG, but I seriously considered it. In hindsight, that was a several million dollar missed opportunity.

I think are are considerably overestimating the net benefit to society from most businesses. There are a lot more pointless things that have attracted billions in external capital than there are truly world-changing businesses that are net benefits to society, mainly because the things that are extremely beneficial are very rarely extraordinarily profitable. Most startups are simple arbitrage opportunities in niche sectors that make X process incrementally more efficient, or worse yet, competitors in crowded spaces who are just charging less money than the incumbent.

The first plank of capitalism is that it entails risk. You cannot sensibly invest without assessing the chance for loss. If venture firms relied on groupthink rather than financial due diligence, that was their doing. In the case of Signature, which was exposed to the crypto industry, the rescue probably bailed out gamblers on speculative assets.

Federal officials have seized on a technicality to claim that it is not a bailout: Any required rescue payments will come from a special assessment on (private) banks, not the public. Prudent banks, which hedged their exposure to interest rates and suffered a competitive cost for doing so, will be hit with the added expense. Most likely, banks will pass along the rescue costs in the form of higher fees to consumers.

Strictly speaking, President Biden’s assurance that taxpayers are not on the line was accurate. However, in the sense that banking customers are a pretty big group, the “public” will be affected.”

The basic idea is that what we think of in the modern age as a Bank is a complicated institution built around an incredibly primitive financial service: money lending.

Money, as the most liquid and fungible form of capital, is required for a capitalist economy to function. It represents abstract ownership, which is necessary for fueling the division of profit between the owner and laborer. In other words, if a laborer produces a product which is then exchanged for some form of value, how is that value distributed between the owner and laborer? We can't split a cow.

Because money is necessary for capitalism, a statement even the technowatermelons that run NFT twitter accounts will attest to (how else can their special McNugget coin gain value if it isn't being used by anyone?), then there must be a money lender. Why?

Well the most straight forward answer is that [money is debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_theory_of_money). Money represents value owed to the holder. A dollar is only valuable because it can be exchanged, transferring that debt to a new holder. The fundamental value of bitcoin is just the same: it can be exchanged, either for a product or as part of a currency market.

In a fiat system, the fundamental lender is the currency issuer. In the blockchain system (at least the ones I'm familiar with), currency is lent by the minter/staker with the issuing value participating in the network.

And of course, the demand for money lending, either through treasury bills or standard currency, requires a *banked* pool of money from which to lend. Institutions that wish to engage in money lending must then incentivize capital owners (you and me) to leave our money with them. This manifests in many many ways, the most important being the interest rate.

The bank is fundamental to a capitalist economy. You cannot have private ownership of the means of production without money, and you cannot have money without an entity that is issuing that money.",2,technology
jd1oo1c,11q9sgl,2023-03-21 04:43:10,LucidiK,"I do appreciate you getting back to me, figured this thread was dead. 

I agree with a lot of your points but do have some hangups. Largely that all money is debt. You say it's an abstraction of ownership but it's really an abstraction of value. Some money is debt based like representative money or fiat but if you own commodity money then you actually own that thing. Debt might be issued with it but that doesn't make it part of the money. 

Money may be necessary for Capitalist society. Although I can imagine a theoretical society that doesn't use money but still governs itself based on private ownership, the concept of profit seems to be tied pretty firmly to finance. Circling back to the original prompt, just because money is needed, does not mean that lending is. If there is money at the core of the society, there will almost definitely be lending. There was lending before money and money turbo charged it. But money and debt are disparate things, even if they are almost always together. Just like money and central banks. Usually together but no central bank issued elemental gold or exist in a cigarette economy like in some jails. 

The miners dont issue the currency. And aren't lent it from the protocol. Unless the earth is just lending us gold. If the idea that all money is debt is because it can be traded or used in the future and will be owed that value in the future, then every single thing in existence that is not being actively consumed is a form of debt. Food is debt because those calories won't actually be mine until I digest them.",1,technology
