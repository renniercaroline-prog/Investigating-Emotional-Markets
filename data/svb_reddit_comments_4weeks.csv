Now because interest rates have gone up so much relatively quickly those long-term bonds pay little compared to the short-term bonds today (3 month, etc.) So, the bonds that were once good for the bank now aren't paying well enough nor are they valuable enough on the market to materially recoup their money.

It all probably would've worked out OK if they didn't see so much deposit runoff.

Not a huge problem if you are holding them to maturity, but if you need to sell them then you have to sell them at a huge loss. 

Banks are therefore susceptible to bank runs. If a lot of clients try to withdraw deposits, the only way the bank can get the money to fulfill the deposits is to sell the assets. So now they have to realize the losses because they’re selling the treasuries instead of holding them to maturity. 

In the case if SVB, the losses of their treasury holdings is larger than the value of the company.",1,investing

jbpq8mq,11nu4pb,2023-03-10 19:42:54,ProcessMeMrHinkie,"I understand that, but when you have a note paying 1.6% (example) and hold until maturity, you don't lose money (outside of inflation).

If you sell prior to maturity, sure you can lose money based on current going rate of the bond/note and whether people are trying to get out of lower yielding funds (1.6% past) so they can jump into higher yielding funds (5.2% current).

Normal banks have enough liquidity that they can hold onto bought treasuries to maturity while using other customers' funds to pay off people withdrawing. When a bank run occurs, net outflows/withdrawals increase such that they don't have the liquidity to maintain a profitable position and **must** **sell at loss**. The lack of liquidity causes the sell-off and realization of loss.

If interest rates were static or had marginally increased vs. the interest they were receiving from the treasuries they could find liquidity to fill the gap. But since interest rates have increased dramatically, no one is willing to inject liquidity into their venture because it's a net loser and makes no sense (if I lend them money to pay their depositors I'll likely be getting less in return than current treasuries or CDs or much higher risk).",1,wallstreetbets

but it without question creates downward forces on the overall economic prosperity and upward momentum of wages, more supply in jobs means pay can decrease, and desparate people will take less pay to do the same task. this is part of the reason for strict controls on low/no skill labor and immigration. because low/no skill labor is supposed to go to young adults, and if young adults cannot find jobs then some will turn to crime, which costs a lot in the long term and low/unskilled labor is only going to in lower and lower demand as aumtation becomes cheaper and cheaper (a tale as old as time..)

 

  

so, sure, these people likely would have found other jobs, and paid taxes, etc.. but losing 80k jobs especially in some towns is a huge overall impact and creates a lot of downward pressure on local economies.    

  

like i said as well, the government should not be bailing out companies that fail due to their own incompetance (stuff like covid i dont have as much of an issue with, it was a wild time and thats part of why we pay taxes, for the government to stabilize the wild times). but the GM situation ended up being a positive argument for government bailout imo. the net benefit was significant.",1,wallstreetbets

jbrhx7o,11nqfsm,2023-03-11 03:31:34,Aevykin,"FROM OCC:

The deliverable for SIVB options contracts will remain the underlying 100 SIVB Shares.
No Exercise Restrictions
OCC has determined not to impose any exercise restrictions with respect to SIVB options. Therefore, OCC will continue to accept and process exercise instructions in accordance with its Rules and as further described below. Because OCC has been informed NSCC will not accept exercise/assignment transactions involving SIVB for settlement, such settlement will be effected as follows.
Broker-to-Broker Settlement
Pursuant to OCC By-Law Article VI, Section 19, OCC has determined that, effective with exercises of March 10, 2023 and thereafter, all SIVB exercise and assignment activity shall settle on a broker-to-broker basis. The deliverable for SIVB options contracts will remain 100 SIVB Shares. If it is not possible for the delivering Clearing Member to effect delivery of the SIVB shares on the designated settlement date, then the settlement obligations of both delivering and receiving Members shall be delayed until such time as OCC designates a new exercise settlement date, settlement method and/or settlement value. This determination allows delivering Members the opportunity to effect settlement if they have SIVB shares and are able to effect delivery but delays the settlement obligation when this is not possible. Both the delivering and receiving Clearing Members are required to immediately notify OCC if they are unable to effect settlement.
In determining that delivery of the SIVB shares is in fact not possible in respect of a given exercise or assignment, OCC shall require an appropriate officer(s) of the delivering Clearing Member to represent in writing that delivery is not possible. (Upon exercise or assignment of SIVB options, OCC will contact SIVB delivering Clearing Member to provide the specific requirements and procedures for such representation.)
Pursuant to customary OCC broker to broker settlement procedures, inability to effect delivery may subsequently occasion cash settlement as determined by OCC.",3,wallstreetbets

The other irony here is that banks were screaming for rate increases bc they wanted to loan money at higher rates, and pay depositors next to nothing which is traditionally how a bank makes money.

It took several tries to log in. And it was already too late then, it didn’t go through. Then, Friday it was impossible to log in (prior to the shut down). 

Now, SVB portal has always been buggy, but it’s probably fair to say that those who move first, can move fast &amp; easy due to everything happening online. Then, the site gets overloaded as more and more try to do the same. And as the bank catches up, they intentionally slow withdrawals since they know they can’t keep up, until it’s all shut down.

So, from a tech perspective I’d anticipate something similar on the stock market…early birds can do what they want, and then it becomes exponentially difficult as time passes (in the matter of hours).

jbsow5e,11nxkje,2023-03-11 12:15:21,SomeGuyNamedPaul,"Things were fine with English until the Normans invaded in various forms and then all the regular words got replaced with fancier versions of the same thing which were just copies of the French equivalent.  There were already words like meat, but then because of *boeuf* the word beef showed up.  That's what happens when the people running the place effectively speak a different language, their manner of speaking becomes the high-society language and the base words are relegated to being not as fancy.  From a purely numbers standpoint approximately an eighth of the French language was dropped into English.  If it's a rich guy telling a peasant to get that roster they're going to use the word *coq* and soon roosters are also cocks.  Other words like literature had no equivalent for the folks shoveling shit.

So that happened, but English pronunciation still sounded gutteral next to the flowy French language so what we think of as the British accent started to emerge in the 1700s out of English high society who wanted to sound fancier.  One of the first acts of rebellion in the American colonies was to not take up this accent.  It wasn't universally rejected though and certain pockets of the colonies did start to shift, notably Boston due to their being heavily dependent upon trade with England.  This is why to this day the Boston accent is as it is, it's a British accent that got ripped from the womb and then never finished developing.  Listen to it in your head, it's kind of like a malformed cockney.

The takeaway here is that what we know as the British accent didn't exist prior to the 1700s, at all.  What's the best modern representation of the English accent that existed prior to that?  'Murica Fuck Yeah!  Therefore Robin Hood or any period movies should in no way have a British accent but rather an American one.  That royal court portrayed in the viking shows all need to sound like the cast of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.  Monty Python And The Holy Grail?

jbsvmm2,11nuooj,2023-03-11 13:26:16,AltOnMain,"It’s not a ponzi scheme, but the bank probably mismanaged their assets. Most of SVB customers were tech companies or tech adjacent. Tech companies haven’t been doing as good so they have less revenue coming in (to SVB) and are pulling more of their reserves for operating capital (from SVB). 

This caused a greater demand for cash than SVB anticipated so they needed to sell some of their near cash assets. The problem is, a lot of their near cash assets are held as bonds and certain bonds have taken a beating. For example they have a lot of treasury bonds that yield 2%. Well, you can go out today and buy a treasury bond that yields 4.5% so who wants to pay face value for the 2% bond? 

Anyways, this means that they have less cash on hand than they thought and they are way less liquid than they thought. They probably got a big capital call or two earlier this week and the bank was like “uhhhhh, we will get back to you about that” and the customer was probably like “what do you mean, you are a bank, give me my fucking money”.

It's also peculiar how many fixed-rate securities SIVB owned.  56% of their portfolio was fixed-rate securities, vs 25%-30% for most US banks.  SIVB had the wrong customer base for investment in MBS, and they bought way too much of it.  It can be prevented by doing what most banks do:  Loan primarily at variable rates and don't keep too many fixed-rate securities in the portfolio.  And, if you are going to invest heavily in long-term securities, make sure your deposit base is consistent enough to support that.",3,stocks

No, not at all.

Ponzi schemes fall apart because you run out of new money coming in to pay off old ""investors""- that's a mathematical inevitability.

That's nothing like a bank run.

SVB was a profitable bank -- could have gone on operating for 50 years, there's no mathematical inevitability to its failure.

It had a problem of a deposit base that was mostly substantially in excess of government insurance -- eg the commercial depositors had a big incentive to exit early.

That's one of the reasons why traditional bank deposits are so valuable -- those ""mom and pop"" depositors, with under $250k in assets, they don't need to be on a hair trigger to cash out before the other guy does. But a venture backed company with $10 mm in the bank . . . they \_do\_ have to jump ""right now"". In this case, they had losses from interest rate moves, but they had a plan in place to shore up the balance sheet . . . unfortunately the run was so fast that the deal couldn't get done in time.",2,investing

But banks were allowed to use depositors money to invest in the stock market - roaring 1920s thousands of radio and car companies that had a mania that eventually folded went bust with the stock market crash and then everything started to follow like dominos. People started seeing lines at banks and there were bank runs. We see it sometimes in other countries today when there is uncertainty, coups, etc. it is all about confidence- after the stock market crash and the bank runs they changed a lot of things. One of it was fed being the bank of last resort where banks could get the cheapest interbank loans however there use to be a bad signal if you had to go to the fed. It meant you weren’t doing well and other banks weren’t lending money to you. 

Lots of things are based on trust and confidence in the system. That’s why I hated crypto and the conmen and weirdos they attracted. No regulations meant many people bought financial instruments they didn’t understand or things that were clearly manipulated (pumped and dumped.) and lost entire life savings.

jbtgtt8,11nxkje,2023-03-11 16:12:02,Ritz_Kola,"To add to this, the Southern \[American\] accent (Both Black American &amp; White American) is also the old British accent.

So why does it sound different than the Boston accent?

1. Britain had various accents throughout the island (yes it's an island)
2. Different timeframes of contact with England
3. Differing opinions of being ""High/Upper Class"" between the South &amp; the North.

Fun fact: These accents were further tweaked by the merging of dialects and language with incoming cultures. It's why of all the South, Black Americans from Miami &amp; New Orleans sound the most unique. They stick out. The much more media famous New Orleans accent is due to french influence. The Miami accent is due to Bahamian influence. Bahamians were in South Florida before Black Americans were, and had already established towns and villages. When the freed AAs moved south from the Carolinas to South Florida and in particular Miami, the two groups were forced to merge together via segregation and jim crow laws. What was born was the present day Miami accent. A combination of Southern talk and Bahamian dialect.

Not too many places in the South had these types of external influence so the ""stereotypical"" southern accent usually covers most of it.

If you're ever in Miami and hear the word &gt;!gook!&lt; it's not what it means on the west coast, or other parts of the country. It's a shortened form of gobbledygook. The islands (West Indies) were British territory for hundreds of years and upper class English speaking islanders well...spoke the English vernacular of the time. The better you spoke it the more ""upper class"" you seemed. That word came to Miami with the Bahamians. Who were already here in the 1800s and would continue to pour in throughout the early 20th century before segregation laws made it very difficult. It holds the same meaning today. **A fool/someone doing foolish things/an idiot/someone who's tripping aka bugging out/someone who has hilarious unfortunate events happen to them/someone who consistently has negative events happen/someone who has embarrassed themselves/and someone you wish to disrespect.** It can be hilarious or be fighting words; just depends on the timing and execution and tone of voice. Other Bahamian words commonly used in Black American Miami are: Jitterbugs which most of the country now hears as ""Jitt"" in rap songs &amp; ""Jitney"" which means ""Bus"" in Bahamas. Except in Miami we really had the Jitney or the Bus. The jitney was alot smaller than the bus, and had zero a/c and was always packed. And it ran from Overtown to Lemon City. Today Lemon City has been largely displaced with the boom of Haitian migrants in the late 20th century, and has been renamed Lil Haiti (""Little"" Haiti for the tourists). Overtown was the first major community (Once named ""Coloured Town"") where Bahamians were kicked out of Coconut Grove (Yes they built that area) and forced into AA neighborhoods; ground zero for the birth of  modern Black Miami.

Just went into the rabbit hole of accents and dialect.",1,wallstreetbets

**How Does A Large Bank Collapse In 48 Hours?**
  
This week, the go-to bank for US tech startups rapidly came unglued, leaving its high-powered customers and investors in limbo. Silicon Valley Bank, facing a sudden bank run and capital crisis, spectacularly collapsed Friday morning and was taken over by federal regulators. It was the largest failure of a US bank since Washington Mutual in 2008.
  
**What is SVB?**
  
Founded in 1983, SVB specialized in banking for tech startups. It provided financing for almost half of US venture-backed technology and health care companies.
  
While relatively unknown outside of Silicon Valley, SVB was among the top 20 American commercial banks, with $209 billion in total assets at the end of last year, according to the FDIC.
  
**Why did it fail?**
  
In short, SVB encountered a classic run on the bank. Yet, it was a confluence of cumulative events over the past few years that set the stage for SVB’s rapid demise. Indeed, several forces collided to take down the banker for tech startups.
  
First, there was the Federal Reserve, which began raising interest rates a year ago to tame inflation. The Fed moved aggressively, and higher borrowing costs derailed the highflying tech stocks that had fueled and benefited SVB. Basically, SVB’s failure was an unintended consequence of 2022 tech stock crash.
  
Higher interest rates pretty much destroyed the value of long-term bonds that SVB had gobbled up during the era of ultra-low, near-zero interest rates. SVB used these ultra-low interest bonds to help finance high growth tech startups. But when the tech tide went out in 2022, SVB was sitting on a ton of low yielding debt. SVB’s $21 billion bond portfolio was yielding a lowly 1.79% — the current 10-year Treasury yield is about 3.9%.
  
At the same time, venture capital began drying up, forcing startups to draw down funds held by SVB. So the bank was sitting on a mountain of unrealized losses in bonds just as the pace of customer withdrawals was escalating.
  
**Then the panic hit…**
  
On Wednesday, SVB announced it had sold a bunch of securities at a loss, and that it would also sell $2.25 billion in new shares to shore up its balance sheet. This set off alarm bells all over Wall Street. SVB’s attempt to raise such a huge amount of cash, shortly after selling a significant amount of securities at a loss, triggered a panic among key venture capital firms, who reportedly advised companies to withdraw their money from the bank immediately.
  
The bank’s stock began plummeting Thursday morning, and by the afternoon it was dragging other bank shares down with it. This situation was just a little too familiar, and investors began to fear a potential repeat of the 2007-2008 financial crisis. By Friday morning, trading in SVB shares was halted and it had abandoned efforts to quickly raise capital or find a buyer. California regulators intervened, shutting the bank down and placing it in receivership under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
  

  
**What’s next?**
  
Smaller banks that are disproportionately tied to capital-intensive industries like tech and crypto may be in for a rough ride, according to Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.
  
“Everyone on Wall Street knew that the Fed’s rate-hiking campaign would eventually break something, and right now it looks like the chickens are finally come home to roost,” Moya said on Friday.
  
The FDIC typically sells a failed bank’s assets to other banks, using the proceeds to repay depositors whose funds weren’t insured.",1,stocks

How on earth did the regulators try to call Ether and stablecoins a security (pretending to be proactive) while they were knowingly enabling banks to use customer deposits which were mostly crypto to lend (in the case of Silvergate at least)? In 2008, the instrument used was home mortgage, this time it is crypto.

I am sure right when Silvergate and hedge fund managers found an opportunity to over-leverage their payment rail (and that rail was to settle crypto txs!) for big time profit in the bull market, it was always going to result in loss for public. As a Web3 professional, I find it ridiculous for a fiduciary to rely on a volatile and young industry like crypto.

In fact these banks are just middlemen. As I say, executive branch is responsible for this mess.

Investors were throwing so much money at startups that the bank had no idea what to do with all their deposits, so they threw much of it into relatively safe long term investments. Safe as long as you actually wait long enough.

Not so safe when you have to turn them back into money at a moment's notice.

The bank apparently had enough assets to cover all the deposits.

If their customers had listened like the customers in ""It's a Wonderful World"" things likely would have been fine.

However silicon valley is mostly run by people who would never cooperate in a prisoners dilemma type situation.  Much of the industry is built upon being ruthless and unafraid to inconvenience others.

They all wanted their money out because they were afraid that all the others like them would want their money out and leave them with nothing.

Also, no jobs in that local area means many small businesses will die because who is gonna buy $25 ramen in a fancy bowl?

Basically it could domino for the entire tech market. On the upside, anyone with cash who wanted these firms, expect a fire sale if the FDIC can't recover the cash. Don't forget the federal reserve has been wanting a economic down turn, if rates were to raise again, this would further devalue those bonds, and the threat of more rate hiking would push them lower, which massively decreases any chance of getting the assets back for those above the FDIC insurance rate.

jbwmxe4,11n5f70,2023-03-12 07:52:03,Alpha-MA,"Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was thriving. Credit losses are fairly low. Its deposits TRIPLED from 2019 to ‘21.

1. When banks accept deposits from clients, they OWE the client that money. So deposits are liabilities to the bank. Liabilities cost money……”cost” both to serve those clients (branches, tellers etc ) and any interest the bank pays you on your checking account (deposit).

2. To pay for the cost of those liabs, banks turn them into assets: lending deposits as small business loans, mortgages, etc.
If a bank can’t lend deposits responsibly, it often uses excess to BUY loans or “securities,” like US Treasuries &amp; Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS)

3. As mentioned above, from 2019-2021, the deposits tripled! SVB needed to take those funds &amp; acquire “assets” to pay its costs.

4. Much of the $ was from VC-backed companies that needed a place to deposit the $ they raised. Those are big deposits. 

5. Deposits were pouring in too fast to lend responsibly. SVB recognized that. Rather than make dumb loans, SVB bought assets guaranteed by the US government - Treasuries and MBS. BUT, it bought long duration. Often 10+ year bonds. 

Mistake!

6. When rates rise, fixed income prices fall.
A general rule of thumb is for every one year of “duration,” each 1%  interest rate move impacts the price of the bond by:

1% x Duration

A 1% move on a 9 yr duration bond is ~9% +/- on the bond price.

But banks are levered…

7. Remember: banks generally acquire assets by using deposits (liabilities) as the capital source. 

And banks like SVB are levered 10:1 or more: owing $10+ for every $1 of shareholder equity. 

If you’re levered 10x, a 10% loss on assets is a 100% wipeout. 

8. So SVB bought high quality assets, but it bought tons of them with LONG duration at LOW interest rates. 

When the Fed raised rates, those assets declined in value…

…1% x Duration. 

Those losses, multiplied through the leverage at SVB, caused a big problem!

9. SVB now has a mark-to-market hole in its balance sheet. It’s “just” mark-to-market: as long as its liabilities are sticky (ie, depositors leave their money SVB), it will ultimately be fine.
But that’s a big “if.”

10. Technically, if all the depositors ask for their $ back at once, SVB needs to sell those bonds at the mark-to-market value, crystallizing what could have been a temporary loss. And if those losses are big enough, it may not have enough money to pay out all depositors.

11. But that situation rarely happens. However, once it starts, game theory kicks in: NOBODY wants to be the last depositor at a bank.

12. Which brings us to today. SVB has large depositors. Large depositors aren’t fully insured by the FDIC - they have an incentive to find HIGHLY sound banks. Once a whiff of issue pops up, large depositors run…“bank run.”

13. As a bank’s deposits go in reverse, it has to sell assets. The FHLB steps in to help turn its less liquid assets into more liquid.",1,investing

Well technically they didn’t even need to do that but the bank run made it infeasible. No bank can survive this type of bank run especially now with the feds raising rates. Simply put these bonds are supposed to be safe and not move in value. Historically that would be true but the fed is fighting inflation atm which makes it not true.

The CEO delivered his message incredibly poorly but if clients didn’t run, things would have been fine just as he said. The bank was well capitalized in terms of normal banking operations. Even the sale of the securities that resulted in the 1.8B loss was to bring up cash reserves up from -4% (which is the minimum) to -6% and wasn’t going to be a big deal bottom line. The year likely would have still been profitable for the bank, they just would have missed expectations. He made a conservative(ish) move and the market panicked.

Simply put, Greg Becker has no tact and every single one of his actions in this area was incredibly poor.

This wasn’t a situation that immediately had to happen.
1. It could have waited until the SilverGate news died down.
2. They didn’t all need to sell at once.
3. No one should ever say, don’t panic in an official message from the ceo.
4. When delivering messages after the fact, the ceo could have not wore clothing associated with a luxury resort in a fancy af home office. That doesn’t send a ‘we’re all in this together message’ Greg will ultimately be fine, his ego and reputation are tarnished.

jc7iblp,11nxkje,2023-03-14 16:39:55,GoStockYourself,"You would not even understand the ""English"" spoken during the viking days.  That was hundreds of years before Chaucer who is very difficult to understand today. English was in it's infancy and was not far from the Germanic languages spoke by the vikings. The Angles, Saxons and Jutes had only arrived in what would become England a few hundred years later.  

Then William the Conqueror founded England as we know it.  In fact the courts and offices did everything in both Germanic and French so everyone could understand.  Hence the birth of legal couplets.  

The accent of Shakespeare's time has been well studied and many of his puns actually help figure out the dialect.  True it doesn't sound like RP English which came later, but saying it was like US English is simply wrong.  Dead wrong.  You can google and find hundreds of links to what it may have sounded like.  It didn't sound like NY or Philly.

English has constantly evolved.  We like to think of it as a Germanic Language, but it has always had a Latin influence.  The Romans were there before France existed.  Either way the first English King was French, so it wasn't exactly a corruption of the language- which didn't exist as we know it back then anyway.
