At 5% they'll just take the interest.   

In 2020 I predicted that 80% of the SP500 will not exist by 2030 in its current form.  There will be mergers, acquisitions, taking companies private, etc.  But there will also be bankruptcies and LOTS of them.  

These companies are so overleveraged that at 5% they are scrambling.   Inflation is so high that rates need to be closer to 10%.   They're all meat at that point and they don't have any equity buffer because the idiots repurchased all their shares.

SVB got fucked because of their unique VC deposit scheme, VC's wanted to pull their money. But SVB, being totally regarded, bought long treasuries with their deposit funds.

jbpq8mq,11nu4pb,2023-03-10 19:42:54,ProcessMeMrHinkie,"I understand that, but when you have a note paying 1.6% (example) and hold until maturity, you don't lose money (outside of inflation).

If you sell prior to maturity, sure you can lose money based on current going rate of the bond/note and whether people are trying to get out of lower yielding funds (1.6% past) so they can jump into higher yielding funds (5.2% current).

Normal banks have enough liquidity that they can hold onto bought treasuries to maturity while using other customers' funds to pay off people withdrawing. When a bank run occurs, net outflows/withdrawals increase such that they don't have the liquidity to maintain a profitable position and **must** **sell at loss**. The lack of liquidity causes the sell-off and realization of loss.

If interest rates were static or had marginally increased vs. the interest they were receiving from the treasuries they could find liquidity to fill the gap. But since interest rates have increased dramatically, no one is willing to inject liquidity into their venture because it's a net loser and makes no sense (if I lend them money to pay their depositors I'll likely be getting less in return than current treasuries or CDs or much higher risk).",1,wallstreetbets

The russian banks responded by limiting user access to their funds and their central bank forced citizens to reduce their foreign currency holdings so that the ruble would stabilize.  If you were a russian holding dollars instead of rubles in a russian bank you lost control of your financial decision-making.  The governments only concern was their own fiat currency and preventing a total collapse, so they used private citizens savings to do so.  

Those who live in parts of the world where the government is prone to doing this have the option to use decentralized financial systems to protect themselves from government overreach.  Their purchasing power is dependent on what crypto assets they buy and the speculative nature of those markets.  But in this example, russians who held dollars in their banks were forced to liquidate those dollars.  A russian holding a dollar stablecoin would be able to circumvent that.",1,wallstreetbets

Technically the Fed is also the one that requires a certain quality and level of reserves and generally banks turn to treasuries after 2008.  But there simply weren’t enough short term to build a robust book.  Quite simply congress and the treasury dropped their low interest covid bags on bond buyers at gun point by the fed.

The other irony here is that banks were screaming for rate increases bc they wanted to loan money at higher rates, and pay depositors next to nothing which is traditionally how a bank makes money.  Don’t think they expected it for o make it to 4% and climbing and now their balance sheets are weighing them down.",2,wallstreetbets

By selling at a loss, they drove up losses, making their results look worse and caused perceived risk to rise. Depositors then fleed as a mob, exacerbating SVB's capital inflow needs.  Perhaps there was an oversight rule that drove them to sell, but I'm not sure.

jbsmx8h,11nuooj,2023-03-11 11:51:10,xiaochenshu,"My company initiated a withdrawal late Thursday evening, after it became clear that the crash was inevitable due to too many VCs advising companies to move the money out during the day. It took several tries to log in. And it was already too late then, it didn’t go through. Then, Friday it was impossible to log in (prior to the shut down). 

Now, SVB portal has always been buggy, but it’s probably fair to say that those who move first, can move fast &amp; easy due to everything happening online. Then, the site gets overloaded as more and more try to do the same. And as the bank catches up, they intentionally slow withdrawals since they know they can’t keep up, until it’s all shut down.

So, from a tech perspective I’d anticipate something similar on the stock market…early birds can do what they want, and then it becomes exponentially difficult as time passes (in the matter of hours).

A significant portion of tech companies are with SVB due to the very ideal terms they normally extend to startups.
As for payroll companies, Rippling already communicated they have a Chase account they’re going to try to use to move payroll. ADP is supposedly working directly with FDIC to ensure no gaps in payroll. TriNet requires affected clients to direct wire money to a new account, but IMO they are a fool to not say there will be a delay in payroll and to think that is the right solution.

jbsow5e,11nxkje,2023-03-11 12:15:21,SomeGuyNamedPaul,"Things were fine with English until the Normans invaded in various forms and then all the regular words got replaced with fancier versions of the same thing which were just copies of the French equivalent.  There were already words like meat, but then because of *boeuf* the word beef showed up.  That's what happens when the people running the place effectively speak a different language, their manner of speaking becomes the high-society language and the base words are relegated to being not as fancy.  From a purely numbers standpoint approximately an eighth of the French language was dropped into English.  If it's a rich guy telling a peasant to get that roster they're going to use the word *coq* and soon roosters are also cocks.  Other words like literature had no equivalent for the folks shoveling shit.

So that happened, but English pronunciation still sounded gutteral next to the flowy French language so what we think of as the British accent started to emerge in the 1700s out of English high society who wanted to sound fancier.  One of the first acts of rebellion in the American colonies was to not take up this accent.  It wasn't universally rejected though and certain pockets of the colonies did start to shift, notably Boston due to their being heavily dependent upon trade with England.  This is why to this day the Boston accent is as it is, it's a British accent that got ripped from the womb and then never finished developing.  Listen to it in your head, it's kind of like a malformed cockney.

The takeaway here is that what we know as the British accent didn't exist prior to the 1700s, at all.  What's the best modern representation of the English accent that existed prior to that?  'Murica Fuck Yeah!  Therefore Robin Hood or any period movies should in no way have a British accent but rather an American one.  That royal court portrayed in the viking shows all need to sound like the cast of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.  Monty Python And The Holy Grail?  Sorry, even a New Yorker accent is more accurate.  Any kind of Shakespeare play?  Don't even try to speak like Grand Moff Tarkin.",10,wallstreetbets

jbsvmm2,11nuooj,2023-03-11 13:26:16,AltOnMain,"It’s not a ponzi scheme, but the bank probably mismanaged their assets. Most of SVB customers were tech companies or tech adjacent. Tech companies haven’t been doing as good so they have less revenue coming in (to SVB) and are pulling more of their reserves for operating capital (from SVB). 

This caused a greater demand for cash than SVB anticipated so they needed to sell some of their near cash assets. The problem is, a lot of their near cash assets are held as bonds and certain bonds have taken a beating. For example they have a lot of treasury bonds that yield 2%. Well, you can go out today and buy a treasury bond that yields 4.5% so who wants to pay face value for the 2% bond? 

Anyways, this means that they have less cash on hand than they thought and they are way less liquid than they thought. They probably got a big capital call or two earlier this week and the bank was like “uhhhhh, we will get back to you about that” and the customer was probably like “what do you mean, you are a bank, give me my fucking money”.

With interest rates higher though those bonds they were using to back deposits were at a couple percent loss. Not a huge deal except it moved that loss to the banks books and tanked their stock price. 

Now a banks stock price isn’t really that correlated to their financial solvency, they were backed on deposits at a rate of 50% which is almost twice what you’re supposed to be by law.

Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB) Shares Dropped Over 60% Before Trading was Halted

The Effect was Felt Throughout the Financial Sector
In the Past 5 Days:

	•	PacWest Bancorp is down 51%
	•	Charles Schwab is down 23.75%
	•	Bank of America is down 11.9%
	•	Goldman Sachs is down 8.08%
	•	JPMorgan is down 7.88%

What Happened?

-	Late Wednesday, Silicon Valley Bank surprised the market by announcing it needed to raise $2.5 billion in stock. The bank had been forced to sell all of its available-for-sale bonds at a $1.8 billion loss as its startup clients withdrew deposits, it said.

-	It’s reported Friday morning that the efforts to raise capital had failed and that SVB had pivoted toward a potential sale.

-	SVB failed on Friday after it couldn’t find a buyer, with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. taking over its assets and liabilities

-	SVB was a major bank for venture-backed companies, which were already under pressure due to higher interest rates

-	This marks the largest U.S. bank failure since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago",2,bayarea

No, not at all.

Ponzi schemes fall apart because you run out of new money coming in to pay off old ""investors""- that's a mathematical inevitability.

That's nothing like a bank run.

SVB was a profitable bank -- could have gone on operating for 50 years, there's no mathematical inevitability to its failure.

It had a problem of a deposit base that was mostly substantially in excess of government insurance -- eg the commercial depositors had a big incentive to exit early.

That's one of the reasons why traditional bank deposits are so valuable -- those ""mom and pop"" depositors, with under $250k in assets, they don't need to be on a hair trigger to cash out before the other guy does. But a venture backed company with $10 mm in the bank . . . they \_do\_ have to jump ""right now"". In this case, they had losses from interest rate moves, but they had a plan in place to shore up the balance sheet . . . unfortunately the run was so fast that the deal couldn't get done in time.",2,investing

The big issues was that 96%+ of their deposits are over the FDIC insurance. Just about all of these big deposits are with Silicon Valley startups. Startups are not doing well. The federal government regulates how banks invest their money and how much can be invested, but not on who you get deposits from (this may need to change). 

Since their deposits were largely in 1 industry and over the FDIC insurance, plus these startups did not spend money on private insurance for their bank deposits(yes you can insurance your bank accounts above FDIC through private insurance), it leaves them susceptible to a run.

There is a youtube channel called Patrick Boyle who is a hedgefund manager. He said they also have a lot of startups from Crypto currency and the crypto crash started the bank run too. 

It was more that they did not have a diversified depositor base and their depositors were too cheap to carry additional bank insurance. 

I think the government needs to look at new regulations

1. diversity of deposits. needs to be in different industries.

2. Requiring businesses to carry separate bank insurance based on a percentage of what they have in the bank. 

3. FDIC should not pay for this. It just raises taxes on the rest of us to cover business risk. No screw them. Carry their own insurance.",2,bayarea

Then he went to both your neighbors and asked for 10$ and told them he could get them 11$ by the following Wednesday. 

Then he went to another four houses and did the same thing with the promise to pay them back 11$ in two weeks.

He used the money from the people who he promised to pay back in two weeks in order to give you and your neighbors $11 each.

Suddenly you, your neighbors, and the people who he hasn't even paid back yet are like ""wow, this guy must be really onto something because he's delivering returns like he promised would happen.""

He tells you he can do it again if you'd like, so this time you and your neighbors give him $100 each.

Also a lot of people who heard about it start to send him money to use his investment strategy on.

He also promises that the longer you leave the money with him, the better your returns will be.

Several people analyze the investment strategy he claims to be using, and say it doesn't add up.

Those people warn the SEC and media that they think something fraudulent is going on, and the SEC and media ignore them for the next 8 years.

Eventually Madoff tells his son's what he's doing because new investments have leveled off, and pretty soon he thinks he won't have enough to cover the fake returns anymore.

His sons, horrified to learn that it was a ponzi scheme this whole time, tell on him, and the scam comes to a very public close.


So the overall difference is like Madoff was selling imaginary gold bars. They never existed in the first place. There was no real strategy. He paid people back with the same money they and others gave him.

SVB it was like they bought a bunch of cars that will *eventually* be considered classics, and therefore more valuable. Right now they're just nice cars that left the lot, so they've lost some short term value. They bought too heavily and didn't leave enough cash in reserve for the people who want their money back now rather than in 10 years when they can sell the cars at a profit.

Most banks actually do what SVB did except for:

1. They have more diversity. Some investments will be worth more within a year, and some will be worth more in 30 years (whereas SVB was all about the 10 year bonds).

2. They keep better cash reserves based on the amount in accounts that are over the insured limit (whereas for SVB almost everything was over the insured limit).


Banks have to use their reserves to invest in *something* because they need to make money. They can't afford branches and staff and online portals for free. At the moment SVB seems like it was a legitimate bank. Although bonds are generally a safe investment their timing was poorly chosen, and because of the nature of who their clients are, they should've kept larger cash reserves.

jbtgtt8,11nxkje,2023-03-11 16:12:02,Ritz_Kola,"To add to this, the Southern \[American\] accent (Both Black American &amp; White American) is also the old British accent.

So why does it sound different than the Boston accent?

1. Britain had various accents throughout the island (yes it's an island)
2. Different timeframes of contact with England
3. Differing opinions of being ""High/Upper Class"" between the South &amp; the North.

Fun fact: These accents were further tweaked by the merging of dialects and language with incoming cultures. It's why of all the South, Black Americans from Miami &amp; New Orleans sound the most unique. They stick out. The much more media famous New Orleans accent is due to french influence. The Miami accent is due to Bahamian influence. Bahamians were in South Florida before Black Americans were, and had already established towns and villages. When the freed AAs moved south from the Carolinas to South Florida and in particular Miami, the two groups were forced to merge together via segregation and jim crow laws. What was born was the present day Miami accent. A combination of Southern talk and Bahamian dialect.

Not too many places in the South had these types of external influence so the ""stereotypical"" southern accent usually covers most of it.

If you're ever in Miami and hear the word &gt;!gook!&lt; it's not what it means on the west coast, or other parts of the country. It's a shortened form of gobbledygook. The islands (West Indies) were British territory for hundreds of years and upper class English speaking islanders well...spoke the English vernacular of the time. The better you spoke it the more ""upper class"" you seemed. That word came to Miami with the Bahamians. Who were already here in the 1800s and would continue to pour in throughout the early 20th century before segregation laws made it very difficult. It holds the same meaning today. **A fool/someone doing foolish things/an idiot/someone who's tripping aka bugging out/someone who has hilarious unfortunate events happen to them/someone who consistently has negative events happen/someone who has embarrassed themselves/and someone you wish to disrespect.** It can be hilarious or be fighting words; just depends on the timing and execution and tone of voice. Other Bahamian words commonly used in Black American Miami are: Jitterbugs which most of the country now hears as ""Jitt"" in rap songs &amp; ""Jitney"" which means ""Bus"" in Bahamas. Except in Miami we really had the Jitney or the Bus. The jitney was alot smaller than the bus, and had zero a/c and was always packed. And it ran from Overtown to Lemon City. Today Lemon City has been largely displaced with the boom of Haitian migrants in the late 20th century, and has been renamed Lil Haiti (""Little"" Haiti for the tourists). Overtown was the first major community (Once named ""Coloured Town"") where Bahamians were kicked out of Coconut Grove (Yes they built that area) and forced into AA neighborhoods; ground zero for the birth of  modern Black Miami.

Just went into the rabbit hole of accents and dialect.",1,wallstreetbets

(The important thing to understand here is that SVB isn't a trash asset, it's actually a *very well* capitalized bank that ran into a minor liquidity crisis that turned into a major liquidity crisis because they mismanaged their communication when announcing a fundraising round and people got spooked and started a run on the bank.  They just didn't have liquid cash on hand *right now* to meet their immediate needs.  So this isn't a matter of getting a bank who's willing to buy a plate of poop; this is a matter of finding a bank capable of bearing the load in the short-term who'll profit long-term because they'll have acquired a ton of new accounts at a fire sale price.)

But that deal really needs to be done by start-of-business Monday morning.  If there's a deal announced later today or on Sunday, then Monday morning will come and it'll be like nothing happened.  The hiccups that happened due to the bank not being available Friday afternoon will all be resolved because the money will just all be there on Monday, and so the impact will just be minor annoyances.   (This outcome is extremely likely to the point it's all-but-certain.)

If there's *not* a deal announced by Monday morning or very *very* shortly thereafter, then this very quickly turns into an extinction level event for startups with massive ripple effects on other companies and is the inciting event of the Next Great Recession.",1,technology

If a bank fails simply due to a run, that means they have a valuable business (just a current lack of trust). They will almost certainly get bought by someone (e.g. JPMC, Goldman) and their depositors will get their money back. Won’t be good for people who invested in the bank but that’s not who people typically care about here. Also, the entity buying the bank has a huge incentive to bid with a price that includes making everyone whole, because that calms people down, and will help prevent a run on their own bank.

if no one buys them, unsecured depositors won’t get all their money back, but they’ll still get a decent portion. If they’re in fact solvent but not liquid, then hypothetically you could just wait a long time and everyone gets their money back. The FDIC won’t wait that long, but it will be significantly better than if everyone pulled deposits at once right away. Although I will say, if no one buys you, there’s some doubt as to whether you are actually solvent…

Madoff didn’t invest shit, he just used money people left with him to pay them the interest, while lying and telling people he was earning interest from investments. Eventually he ran out of money.

SVB was investing in bonds to make money to cover its costs and pay interest. SVB’s investments turned bad, but not enough to collapse the bank. However customers of the bank got worried and tried to withdraw their savings all at once. SVB didn’t have enough cash on hand to pay people out, and their investments currently would have to be sold at a loss to raise cash to cover withdrawals.

So SVB can still sell off their investments and have enough cash to cover the majority of customers deposits. Madoff literally had no money or assets at the end of his scheme, his used all his deposited money to cool his customers into thinking he was investing it really well the entire time.

jbtyg9y,11nucrb,2023-03-11 18:15:23,Nenor,"Several problems with that, not least of which is opportunity cost. Banks' shareholders want tangible returns on their investments. Cash sitting in a vault doesn't do that. Esp. when even risk-free securities can earn something. But investing in capital is risky, so returns required by a bank's shareholders are way higher than risk-free returns. 

Also, banks do buy both goods and services, and quite a lot of them. Even the payroll they pay to their employees is via cash/cash-equivalents payments. And market salaries increase in an inflationary environment, as do all other goods and services. To make things worse, this effect obviously accrues over time, and fast in an inflationary environment. Think about an extreme case, say hyperinflation - if a bank sits on 1,000,000 today, in a few days/weeks (depending on the inflation) with this money, it may not be able to buy a loaf of bread for its canteen.

Realistically, you want to go to a VC/angel that specializes in your particular industry, so that they are asking the right questions, versus just going after flashy shit.

You also have to take into consideration that for many VCs, they are only going after high risk/high reward candidates. Many profitable businesses with sound financials will be a great business overall, but a poor investment decision because of a lower ROI. 

So, it IS akin to financially gambling, but that's the entire purpose.

**How Does A Large Bank Collapse In 48 Hours?**
  
This week, the go-to bank for US tech startups rapidly came unglued, leaving its high-powered customers and investors in limbo. Silicon Valley Bank, facing a sudden bank run and capital crisis, spectacularly collapsed Friday morning and was taken over by federal regulators. It was the largest failure of a US bank since Washington Mutual in 2008.
  
**What is SVB?**
  
Founded in 1983, SVB specialized in banking for tech startups. It provided financing for almost half of US venture-backed technology and health care companies.
  
While relatively unknown outside of Silicon Valley, SVB was among the top 20 American commercial banks, with $209 billion in total assets at the end of last year, according to the FDIC.
  
**Why did it fail?**
  
In short, SVB encountered a classic run on the bank. Yet, it was a confluence of cumulative events over the past few years that set the stage for SVB’s rapid demise. Indeed, several forces collided to take down the banker for tech startups.
  
First, there was the Federal Reserve, which began raising interest rates a year ago to tame inflation. The Fed moved aggressively, and higher borrowing costs derailed the highflying tech stocks that had fueled and benefited SVB. Basically, SVB’s failure was an unintended consequence of 2022 tech stock crash.
  
Higher interest rates pretty much destroyed the value of long-term bonds that SVB had gobbled up during the era of ultra-low, near-zero interest rates. SVB used these ultra-low interest bonds to help finance high growth tech startups. But when the tech tide went out in 2022, SVB was sitting on a ton of low yielding debt. SVB’s $21 billion bond portfolio was yielding a lowly 1.79% — the current 10-year Treasury yield is about 3.9%.
  
At the same time, venture capital began drying up, forcing startups to draw down funds held by SVB. So the bank was sitting on a mountain of unrealized losses in bonds just as the pace of customer withdrawals was escalating.
  
**Then the panic hit…**
  
On Wednesday, SVB announced it had sold a bunch of securities at a loss, and that it would also sell $2.25 billion in new shares to shore up its balance sheet. This set off alarm bells all over Wall Street. SVB’s attempt to raise such a huge amount of cash, shortly after selling a significant amount of securities at a loss, triggered a panic among key venture capital firms, who reportedly advised companies to withdraw their money from the bank immediately.
  
The bank’s stock began plummeting Thursday morning, and by the afternoon it was dragging other bank shares down with it. This situation was just a little too familiar, and investors began to fear a potential repeat of the 2007-2008 financial crisis. By Friday morning, trading in SVB shares was halted and it had abandoned efforts to quickly raise capital or find a buyer. California regulators intervened, shutting the bank down and placing it in receivership under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
  

  
**What’s next?**
  
Smaller banks that are disproportionately tied to capital-intensive industries like tech and crypto may be in for a rough ride, according to Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.
  
“Everyone on Wall Street knew that the Fed’s rate-hiking campaign would eventually break something, and right now it looks like the chickens are finally come home to roost,” Moya said on Friday.
  
The FDIC typically sells a failed bank’s assets to other banks, using the proceeds to repay depositors whose funds weren’t insured.",1,stocks

If a bank just lets that money sit there, not earning the bank any sort of return, it guarantees that ***any*** person / company that deposits money with said bank will be a ***guaranteed*** money losing scenario.

Basically, if what you posited was indeed the situation, SVB wouldn't even have been chartered in the first place. 

It would be like setting up a bakery where the government sets a price cap on the price of a loaf of bread at $1.00, but the current market prices of flour, yeast, etc needed to make a loaf of bread is $2.00. 

Or, if a more recent example is more you're speed, the Feb 2021 Winter Storm Uri freeze in Texas is another good example - Texas state regulators mandate a max price cap on the price of electricity to consumers, which, we can all agree is a good thing, as electricity and power are basic utilities Texans need to survive and go about their daily lives. That being said, a similar scenario took place where **the inputs need to create electricity** (namely natural gas) *did not* have any sort of price cap. So what happened is 
 
1.  we saw a huuuuuge windfall for companies that produce natural gas and sell it in the spot market (Energy Transfer and Kinder Morgan) but 

2. the (unhedged) buyers of that natural gas / sellers of electricity (residential electric utilities) became insolvent pretty quickly when the price of electricity you're selling is fixed and the price of the natural gas you need to produce said electrify **is not**.

Like, why start a business in the first place if there are regulatory mechanisms in place that prevent the owner from earning any sort of return on his or her invested capital? 

**Aside**: this really only applies to the bakery example above, not so much the Feb '21 Winter Freeze since those mechanisms are designed to protect consumers (which is good and an appropriate role for the government to serve in the context of free markets, but with insanely huge barriers to entry in the form of upfront capital spend)......but on the other hand, it also exposes smaller, undercapitalized utilities to a lot of Black Swan-like risk, especially if those smaller utilities are doing a shitty job of managing their commodity risk by lack of price hedges",1,Economics

You run into problems when more than 10% of your depositers want to withdraw their deposits all at once. You run into even bigger problems when 100% of your depositers want to withdraw their deposits all at once - this was the reason that the Federal Reserve was chartered in the first place. 

Last time there was a run on an actual federal depository holding money for regular joes (and not non-boutique / specialty bank like SVB that lends to a very very small subset of borrowers), it was a private citizen, JP Morgan (the guy, not the bank), that had to save the banking system by way of a personal bailout to save the burgeoning financial system in the United States in 1907.

Edit: More info below on the Panic of 1907

&gt;In the summer of 1907, the American economy was showing signs of weakness as a number of business and Wall Street brokerages went bankrupt. In October, the respected [Knickerbocker Trust in New York City](https://devastatingdisasters.com/the-knickerbocker-trust-company-and-the-new-york-bank-panic-1907/) and the [Westinghouse Electric Company](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/252812) both failed, touching off a series of events known as the Panic of 1907.

&gt;In the wake of the initial business collapses, stock market prices plummeted and depositors made a massive run on the nation’s banks. The U.S. Treasury pumped millions of dollars into weak banks in the hope of saving them, but the string of collapsed institutions lengthened.

&gt;In a reprise of his role during the second Cleveland administration when the gold standard was under assault, J.P. Morgan acted to restore order. He summoned the leading bankers and financial experts to his home where they set up shop in his library. Over the course of the next three weeks, Morgan and his associates labored to channel money from the strong institutions to the weaker ones in an effort to keep them afloat.

&gt;The joint effort of the government and the business leaders improved conditions markedly over the course of several weeks. While the crisis passed, the finger-pointing began. Reform elements of both political parties believed that the American banking system was fundamentally flawed and needed wholesale change. Business leaders, however, held that Roosevelt's progressive legislation had upset the natural order of the economy and the government should stop its meddling.

&gt;Following the Panic of 1907, the reform elements gradually gained the upper hand. An emerging consensus affirmed that thorough bank reform was necessary to provide badly needed currency elasticity (a major issue in the Panic) and the general soundness of the banking system. Congress responded by passing stop-gap legislation, the [Aldrich-Vreeland Act (1908)](https://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h953.html), until more thorough actions could be prepared.

&gt;With the passing of the [Owen-Glass Federal Reserve Act of 1913](https://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1052.html), the Federal Reserve System was created. The ""Fed"" was designed to be flexible and responsive to the economy and independent of politics. The Fed has evolved through the years by implementing many strict checks and balances. New departments, the General Accounting Office, GAO, and the Office of Management &amp; Budget, OMB, were created to audit the Fed and most other government departments. As a result, the American economy, and American society are more stable.",5,Economics

Cash is a liability for banks -- they want it to be invested, not held. Reduce the reserve requirement and of course they will invest the cash -- which is fine -- except for when your entire business model depends on liquidity. And then you invest too much into ""super safe"" -- but illiquid -- assets. And then someone wants more than the cash you have on hand -- which you invested way beyond what would be considered safe for your normal liquidity. And now you have to take your ""super safe"" assets to the pawn shop because you need cash now.  And -of course- the pawn shop isn't gonna give you 1:1 value.

Bonds are safe only when you can hold them to maturity. The second you need to offload them, you are suddenly at the mercy of the market.

It's why I never understood how people counted bonds as basically 1:1 for cash, or riskless. They def. have risk.",1,Economics

Investors were throwing so much money at startups that the bank had no idea what to do with all their deposits, so they threw much of it into relatively safe long term investments. Safe as long as you actually wait long enough.

Not so safe when you have to turn them back into money at a moment's notice.

The bank apparently had enough assets to cover all the deposits.

If their customers had listened like the customers in ""It's a Wonderful World"" things likely would have been fine.

However silicon valley is mostly run by people who would never cooperate in a prisoners dilemma type situation.  Much of the industry is built upon being ruthless and unafraid to inconvenience others.

They all wanted their money out because they were afraid that all the others like them would want their money out and leave them with nothing.

How many city's shit themselves when a corporation's back up their offices and move else where, and the local company's no longer have spenders? Back 40 years ago it was much worse, look at Seattle and Boeing back then, small company's lived and breathed off that airplane money. The only difference between that and today is change 1 company for a massive number of smaller ones.

If multiple tech firms (doubt Roku will, but small and medium MSP/MSSP's or application shops) go belly up, this results in those jobs going away, if they don't find new jobs they very well might leave, if they leave houses hit the market for sale (flooding it). Also, no jobs in that local area means many small businesses will die because who is gonna buy $25 ramen in a fancy bowl?

Basically it could domino for the entire tech market. On the upside, anyone with cash who wanted these firms, expect a fire sale if the FDIC can't recover the cash. Don't forget the federal reserve has been wanting a economic down turn, if rates were to raise again, this would further devalue those bonds, and the threat of more rate hiking would push them lower, which massively decreases any chance of getting the assets back for those above the FDIC insurance rate.

Yeah your mistake is assuming opportunity cost of money in the conventional economic sense applies to governments able to print sovereign currency. 

Could have saved the time and avoided writing out those paragraphs that mean jack shit because you assume there is opportunity cost in government bailout. There isn't, that money wasn't going to roads or education even without the bank run.

I'm sure the CEO had no idea rates were going to go up... oh wait... he's on the BOARD OF THE SF FED.

I think we will find out that this bank was in fact NOT managing itself correctly, and it thought it was going to continue on forever with their no interest infinite money glitch, while the rest of us drown in an inflationary shitstorm. Banks typically fail when their clients/investors start pulling their money. I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that they were in deep before that. They are not the only one.

This bank lends almost exclusively to the ultra wealthy. Fuck bailouts for these assholes. We can talk about bailouts when Americans aren't drowning in medical and education debt. Actually, not even then. The people running these corrupt banks should be in prison. In fact, a lot of them should have already been in prison after what they did to our economy 15 years ago, but they got a free pass.

I'm all for making banks do more to protect customers (whether those are corporate customers, as was mostly the case here, or individual customers).  But, you can't reasonably expect them to voluntarily do it, because doing so will put them out of business.  That's why you need laws and regulations.  
  
As far as we can tell from the facts of SVB so far, they weren't doing anything fraudulent and they weren't violating any regulations.  They may have been operating in a less than optimal manner in how they held assets.  
  
When it comes to those bonds, yes, the bank needed to raise some more capital to cover a position they were losing money on, but that happens all the time.  It's part of risk.  They were likely over invested in them, but that didn't cause the bank to fail.  What caused the bank to fail was VC doing what VC does, and that's fuck up everything they touch.  
  
As far as interest rates go, we've been in an artificial economy since 2008, and arguably even earlier due to interest rates that have been far too low.  There's a good chunk of Reddit whose entire adult lives have been spent under suppressed interest rates, myself included to boost the economy.  And they've needed to change that for a long time.  
  
The first serious attempt to do that happened under Obama at the end of his second term (so about 5 years after it should have happened), then Trump immediately had that undone.  Raising rates is the responsible thing to do, but higher rates hits VC hard, and tech is hugely reliant on VC, so the tech sector is taking a big hit as rates go up, as it drastically changes the business model of how tech companies operate.  
  
A bank like SVB, which mostly works with tech companies and tech workers is going to be hit hard when that happens.  And you're right, they should have known that.  But, rates have been going up for a year now, so I'm pretty sure they have known that, and have been adjusting.",2,news

I read something like the following on this post.

&gt;The government needed something to take the fall and SVB was picked.

I very much interpret it as.

&gt;A bubble had to be popped. Popped a bubble was. Bubbles tends to pop.

Let's be honest, this wouldn't happen under no circumstance if the technology industry was still healthy and nurturing profit to everyone's pockets.

I personally think that Web 2.0 is an old concept of technology and it very much represents all of these startups being voraciously funded by VCs even if in their very essence, these startups represent very questionable projects in the hand of even more questionable leadership.

Web 2.0 today is very much a bunch of SaaS solutions being pushed down the throat of companies and consumers without providing a truly innovative or disruptive value as they did some years ago with the advent of social networks, payment platforms, transportation apps, hospitality solutions... Silicon Valley is lacking ideas and creativity for some time now. While the true disruptors have been nurturing innovation in Web 3.0 (blockchains/decentralized economy) and AI economy.

Silicon Valley as we know became an inflated money machine that is not delivering the same amount of value to society as it used to. They couldn't sustain the immense amount of investment they have been receiving because they were not being able to actually market these products and make a solid profit out of them.

My two cents is that all of this will kickstart the true adoption of the decentralized economy (crypto) because as the panic spreads and grow, people will once again realize that they never really owned their money and that even though banks promise only one fundamental thing (trust), they are not always able to provide that. Just like history has shown in the past. The main difference is that now there is an actual alternative to true monetary ownership. Welcome to the age of true autonomy and financial freedom.",1,news

As a C-corp if you miss payroll you open yourself up to broader liabilities which can pierce corporate veil as well. This means if the payroll needs are higher than what depositors will have access to, BKs can happen.

The upside is there's been a lot of action in bridge loans and other financial instruments to hopefully avoid some of that. It's going to be a tenuous situation though I'm a bit more optimistic than when I posted 2 days prior (the interconnectedness of ecosystem is what worried me most). Startups with too high a burn are going to have a rough time getting access to follow on funding though, so regardless of how quickly depositors are made whole (and I do think they will be, with some delay) SVB disappearing leaves a mark that will not be easily remedied -- capital markets for startups were already tightening before this and will tighten a lot further, leading to some faster than usual seed and series A companies churning out.",1,news

Now, at the same time this happened, the bank president announced the losses and the need to shore up its reserves (not unusual-typical transparency to stockholders during an earnings call).  Well, the venture capitalists and fin advisors who were ON that call then started telling all of their clients to get their money out and….you can figure out from there.

Meanwhile, on the other side of things, the bank had a majority of its assets in bonds which are inversely related to interest rates so…rates go up and bond prices go down. The bank’s first choice of raising money was to sell its assets BUT the market was not the best time so…they didn’t get as much as they needed and now none of those VC’s were willing to lend them money…so…deadline came and they didn’t have the required funds and the FDIC declared them insolvent and took over which is what is required.",1,news

jc0acj2,11nvd4e,2023-03-13 02:21:56,xomox2012,"TLDR: No, the bank run and rising interest rates killed that as a possibility. Yes without the bank run.

Well technically they didn’t even need to do that but the bank run made it infeasible. No bank can survive this type of bank run especially now with the feds raising rates. Simply put these bonds are supposed to be safe and not move in value. Historically that would be true but the fed is fighting inflation atm which makes it not true.

The CEO delivered his message incredibly poorly but if clients didn’t run, things would have been fine just as he said. The bank was well capitalized in terms of normal banking operations. Even the sale of the securities that resulted in the 1.8B loss was to bring up cash reserves up from -4% (which is the minimum) to -6% and wasn’t going to be a big deal bottom line. The year likely would have still been profitable for the bank, they just would have missed expectations. He made a conservative(ish) move and the market panicked.

Simply put, Greg Becker has no tact and every single one of his actions in this area was incredibly poor.

This wasn’t a situation that immediately had to happen.
1. It could have waited until the SilverGate news died down.
2. They didn’t all need to sell at once.
3. No one should ever say, don’t panic in an official message from the ceo.
4. When delivering messages after the fact, the ceo could have not wore clothing associated with a luxury resort in a fancy af home office. That doesn’t send a ‘we’re all in this together message’ Greg will ultimately be fine, his ego and reputation are tarnished. On the flip side, all of his thousands of employees are now going to be struggling to pay bills. Depositors etc were just covered in full by the gov so they are fine too.

jc7iblp,11nxkje,2023-03-14 16:39:55,GoStockYourself,"You would not even understand the ""English"" spoken during the viking days.  That was hundreds of years before Chaucer who is very difficult to understand today. English was in it's infancy and was not far from the Germanic languages spoke by the vikings. The Angles, Saxons and Jutes had only arrived in what would become England a few hundred years later.  

Then William the Conqueror founded England as we know it.  In fact the courts and offices did everything in both Germanic and French so everyone could understand.  Hence the birth of legal couplets.  

The accent of Shakespeare's time has been well studied and many of his puns actually help figure out the dialect.  True it doesn't sound like RP English which came later, but saying it was like US English is simply wrong.  Dead wrong.  You can google and find hundreds of links to what it may have sounded like.  It didn't sound like NY or Philly.

English has constantly evolved.  We like to think of it as a Germanic Language, but it has always had a Latin influence.  The Romans were there before France existed.  Either way the first English King was French, so it wasn't exactly a corruption of the language- which didn't exist as we know it back then anyway.
